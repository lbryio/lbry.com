On Linux, the relevant directories are `~/.lbrynet`, `~/.lbrycrd`, and `~/.lbryum`, depending on which wallets you've used. On OS X, the folders of interest are `~/Library/Application Support/LBRY`, `~/Library/Application Support/lbrycrd`, `~/.lbrycrd`, and `~/.lbryum`, again depending on which wallets you've used.
