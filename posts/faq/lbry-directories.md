On linux, the relevant directories are `~/.lbrynet`, `~/.lbrycrd`, and `~/.lbryum`, depending on which wallets you've used. On OS X, the folders of interest are `~/Library/Application Support/LBRY`, `~/Library/Application Support/lbrycrd` `~/.lbrycrd` and `~/.lbryum`, also depending on which wallets you've used.
