title: How does content hosting work?
---

Right now, it's simple: you host what you download.

While the LBRY app is running, it communicates to the network what
content you're making available. If somebody downloads content from
you, you will recieve LBRY credits (LBC) for that. The prices are
currently set by the app and can't be changed.
