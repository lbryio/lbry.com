The LBRY project sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/lbryio).

To install LBRY from source, you'll need the [lbry](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) repository, as well as either [lbrycred](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) or [lbryum](https://github.com/lbryio/lbryum). Further documentation is available in the respective repositories' READMEs and similar files.
