title: When will I get my referral rewards?

You will not get your referral rewards until you are removed from the LBRY wait list.

Each week, more users will get pulled off the wait list. Not all users will be allowed in at once.

There has been a lot of referral fraud, meaning automated fake signups designed to look real. If you did not do this, do not worry. If you are doing this, we appreciate you making our sign up numbers look huge but it will be of no benefit to you.

Please do not ask us questions further questions about this. More details will be coming the week of July 10th and this post will be updated, as well as an announcement sent to all wait list members via email.
