You can earn credits and move up the LBRY waitlist for referring others to use LBRY.

### How do referrals affect my status on the waitlist?

The more LBRYians you refer, the sooner you will be removed from the waitlist and the more credits you earn.

### How many credits do I get?

The current referral reward as well as the number of people you have referred can be seen on the [Get](/get) page.
The referral award may change without warning.

### How do I see how many credits I've earned?

Access the [Get](/get) page. If it does not already display your status when you load the page, simply enter your email address again.

### When do I get my rewards?

You will not receive any credits until you are removed from the waitlist. As soon as you are, you will receive an acceptance bonus. You will not receive rewards for each referral until those users join and use LBRY themselves. This is to combat referral fraud.

### Is there a limit to the credits I can earn?

If you expect to refer more than 50-100 people, please discuss it with us on [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) or email [us](mailto:josh@lbry.io).

### I have a clever idea to cheat the referral system.

If you want to waste your time to receive no reward, be our guest. We will be monitoring the system closely and going to significant lengths to only let legitimate users in.

Rather than spending the time attempting to cheat and failing, we suggest you do productive work to earn LBRY credits. Join our [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) and message Josh (@finer9) or Jeremy (@kauffj) for opportunities.
