LBRY, Inc. controls a significant number of LBRY credits (LBC). At the inception of the blockchain, it was 400,000,000 LBC.

This document outlines LBRY, Inc. policies, disclosures and intentions in administering those credits. Its purpose is to ensure we operate forthrightly and in the best interests of the LBRY community.

## Credit Overview

The initial 400m credits are broken down as follows:

| Name | Amount | Purpose | Wallet (initial) |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| Community | 200m |  Reward early adopters, new users, and community contributions. | [link](https://explorer.lbry.io/address/rMT5Sg8SyFP3ax2PRaweRCRZoMeYw4znEi) |

Specific details of historic, ongoing, and anticipated fund expenditures can be seen in the most recent quarterly report.

## Community Fund

The Community Fund is 200m LBC reserved for spreading usage and adoption of the LBRY protocol. The more people that use and love LBRY, the stronger the LBRY network is.

At a high-level, this fund will be used for the following purposes:

- Seeding consumers with initial credits
- Recruiting producers to use LBRY
- Encouraging all users to share LBRY and invite friends
- Rewarding community contributors

We expect a dispersal of this fund lasting a period a minimum of 5 years and likely closer to 10.

## Operational Fund

The Operational Fund is 100m LBC reserved for LBRY, Inc. itself.

LBRY, Inc. reserves the rights to do whatever it wants with these credits at any time, to be deployed in the best interests of LBRY, Inc.

However, no one believes in the LBRY protocol more, or has more incentive for its success, than LBRY, Inc. We believe LBRY can be an world-altering technology and as such our intentions are to minimize the expenditure of these credits until we've achieved that reality.

Minimal engagement in the market is especially necessary throughout stages of low liquidity, when any action has disproportionate impact.

## Institutional Fund

The Institutional Fund is 100m LBC reserved for the formation of institutional partnerships and benefiting organizations of need, and  institutional partnerships, grants, donations, and other ways of strengthening relationships with organizations of need or like-mindedness.

Sample usages of this fund include:

- Loaning or giving to non-profit or educational publishers to maintain a namespace or make content available
- Partnering with charities or other non-governmental organizations with similar interests to LBRY
- Granting to organizations in need
- Establishing separate entities related to LBRY Inc. (e.g. a non-profit to manage the protocol)
- Strategic partnerships or affiliations with other institutions

LBRY, Inc. anticipates a dispersion period for these tokens significantly exceeding the administration of the community fund. It has no plans to utilize these credits until achieving more community growth and drafting specific programs for participation.
