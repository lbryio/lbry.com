As the touch and interaction point for the vast majority of LBRY users, applications play a tremendous role in the success of the LBRY protocol.

LBRY maintains three applications. All three use either ReactJS or React Native.

- [lbry-desktop](http://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop), an Electron based desktop browser and wallet.
- [lbry-android](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android), a browser and wallet for Android, currently in alpha.
- [spee.ch](https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch), a web-based image and video sharing and self-hosting tool that syncs to the LBRY network.

This position would involve becoming the team leader of all three projects, which each currently have a single full-time engineer working on them.

Success at this position involves strength at both product vision and user-experience as well as code architecture and standards. Being able to showcase previous experience building an engaging and delightful application is a requirement for this position.
