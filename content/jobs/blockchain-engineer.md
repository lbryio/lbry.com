title: Blockchain Lead
order: 1
status: active
location: remote (global)
---

This position involves working directly on the LBRY [blockchain](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd), written in C++. You would be 
responsible for anticipating LBRY's blockchain needs, understanding the tradeoffs between different ways to meet those needs, and 
designing and implementing your chosen solution.

Requirements:

- competence with cryptography, security, and networks
- blockchain development experience (preferably with Bitcoin or similar codebases)
- understanding of the blockchain ecosystem and history (mining, ASICs, exchanges, major design decisions, etc)

Blockchain work can be like being a goalkeeper: good work goes under-appreciated, but mistakes are catastrophic. 
It's helpful to have a mindset that succeeds in the face of these incentives.
