We're seeking someone to manage [this very website](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry.io), as well as other LBRY web properties and projects.

This position involves both design and programming elements and is good for someone with a mix of creativity and logic. The LBRY website currently uses a moderate amount of PHP, but you be the product owner and have full control over the implementation.
