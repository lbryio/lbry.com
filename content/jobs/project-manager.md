Being a project manager at LBRY requires skillful facilitation and coaching of a menagerie of full-time engineers and community contributors. It demands the ability to break down big goals into practical plans and keep track of a wide variety of tasks and small details.

This isn't a typical project management position. LBRY is an open-source, community driven company with few externally driven deadlines and a big focus on transparency.

This role is not to act as a boss of our engineers, but as a facilitator, administrator, and coach. Experience as a project manager in an open-source community is encouraged but not required. Great communication skills, coupled with flexibility and a detail-oriented mindset is necessary.
