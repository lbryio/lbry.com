This job combines the coolest language with a slightly less cool objective for an overall attractiveness quotient of still pretty neat.

Specifically, being an API engineer at LBRY involves creating and modifying web-based API endpoints in Go. These endpoints are used for everything from analytics and user databasing to reward disbursement, notifications, and more.

This is the only closed source project at LBRY. Competence in creating sane, secure, and well-structured API signatures is required, as is a mind for security. Strong knowledge of SQL and data structures is also necessary. This work involves interactions with blockchain, but no direct work on the LBRY blockchain or protocol.
