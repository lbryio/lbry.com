The LBRY protocol consists of a [set of APIs](https://lbry.io/api) provided via a daemon. This daemon is comprised of several sub-components, and interacts with the blockchain, wallet, and other remote daemons that constitute the LBRY data network.

The LBRY [daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) and [wallet](https://github.com/lbryio/lbryum) are both written in Python, but maybe you're the one to rewrite them in Go (we're kidding) (probably).

Competence with security, operating systems, and networks is mandatory. Experience with peer-to-peer technology is beneficial but not required.
