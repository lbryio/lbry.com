Like designing things? Great, because this position involves designing all the things.

The Lead Designer at LBRY is responsible for design, look, feel, and aesthetics of [our logo](https://lbry.io/img/lbry-dark.svg), our applications ([1](http://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) [2](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android) [3](http://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch)), our websites ([1](https://lbry.io) [2](https://beta.lbry.tech)), and [our CEO's hair](https://spee.ch/5/hair.jpg).

We prefer to work with designers who can go from idea to implementation, including working directly in CSS.
