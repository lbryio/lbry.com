If there was a channel to perfectly embody the lyrics of Daft Punk's Technologic, its David L Jones' years-long adventure in electrical and hardware engineering.

Today's #LBRYcast is one of the top engineering shows on the web. Where there's a will to tinker (or likelihood of electric shock), there's a way for David to break it down.

Want to know how your [Trezor hardware wallet](https://open.lbry.io/ee-BzxGoJdd8a4) actually works? How about why [Blu-ray beat out HD-DVD](https://open.lbry.io/ee-HsX9MJK9i4Y) or how [PID controllers](https://open.lbry.io/ee-VVOi2dbtxC0) work? You're in the right place. David demystifies all things electronic into digestible, fun content every other day on [@EEVblog](https://open.lbry.io/%40EEVblog).

Plus–and I'm not saying that correlation equals causation–it's been about a year since indie film studio Oscilloscope Laboratories began adding its film library to LBRY. And what did [@EEVblog](https://open.lbry.io/%40EEVblog) do all summer? [Give away oscilloscopes](https://open.lbry.io/ee-GK462ztpfDk). Talk about oscilloscopes. And giveaway [more oscilloscopes](https://open.lbry.io/ee-vmZoMdaczO0).
