## Good news everyone!

LBRY v0.20 is live, and if you've been waiting in vain for verification, your day has finally come!

![App preview](https://spee.ch/3/2point01.png)

Users can now use SMS to verify that they're human. We've also automated the app upgrade process, updated the LBRY daemon, added a "dark" mode for evening viewing, and fixed an [Electron security issue](https://electronjs.org/blog/protocol-handler-fix).

You can read the [full release notes here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/releases/tag/v0.20.0). If you haven't downloaded the app yet, [what are you waiting for](lbry.io/get)?
