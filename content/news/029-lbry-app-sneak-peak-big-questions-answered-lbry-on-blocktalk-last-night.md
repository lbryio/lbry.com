The LBRY team spoke with the guys at [Decentral Vancouver](http://decentralvancouver.com), one of many Bitcoin-focused collaboration spaces popping up around the world.

The most notable part of the thorough interview was a live demo of the latest LBRY browser app, which is where the video below begins. Our new user interface is damn pretty.

Other highlights from the conversation include:

* Mike Vine coining the term "appcoin" to describe LBRY Credits. Find out what it means starting at 16:32.

* Discussions of the collapse of Cryptsy, [Mike Hearn's "crisis of faith" in bitcoin](http://stfi.re/bedxrb), and LBRY's bitcoin price predictions.

* The answer to the question â€“ should we compare LBRY to Alexandria, Storj, or IPFS?

* Why LBRY is so much more than a marriage of Bitcoin & BitTorrent.
