Continuing with our slate of indie musicians is a young, entrepreneurial artist we found on Twitter.

When we mean LBRY enables anyone to monetize content, we mean from the biggest Disneys to the self-made fresh EPs of artists taking their first leap of faith. It's a level playing field.

Luke Hall recently released his debut EP and spent no time learning the ropes of LBRY. I was so blown away by his commitment to learning LBRY hands-on after a shout-out on Twitter.

This is the first channel I know on LBRY to host a variety of multimedia options--hat tip to Matt Skokol for [his musicians guide to publishing](https://medium.com/@heymattsokol/how-to-upload-and-sell-your-music-on-lbry-fa4f299413a1)--from music videos to mp3 streams to a full downloadable album, everything a musician could offer is available on Luke Hall's LBRY channel at a variety of prices.

Please do yourselves the honor, and get your indie electronica on at:
