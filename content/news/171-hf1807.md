**Update 2018-07-11**: The fork is live. Block 400155 occurred on July 9 at 11:40am EST. Block 401018 (the block with the first difference between forks) occurred on July 11 at 2:27am EST. The prefork chain halted at that block, while the postfork chain is proceeding normally (at block 401361 at the time of writing).

## What's Changing

LBRY is announcing hard fork HF1807. This fork will extend how long claims are valid before they expire. 
Currently, claims expire after about 1.5 years unless they are updated. After the fork takes effect, claims will expire after 10 years.
Existing claims that have not expired will have their expiration extended to 10 years.
Any claims that expire before the fork takes effect will stay expired. We will republish them manually to preserve access to that content.

Only claim expiration is changing. The block rewards, token distribution, hash algorithms, etc. are all staying the same.

The fork will take effect at block 400155, which will occur on July 9th, 2018 at around noon EST.

## What You Should Do

For most people, nothing needs to be done. The fork will take effect transparently and won't change your experience of LBRY.
