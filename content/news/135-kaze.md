Some of the greatest works of art today build upon and remix yesterday's creations, bringing new perspectives to timeless classics.

One of the most persistent and fascinating art-remix communities is the mod community.

[@KazeEmanuar](https://open.lbry.io/%40KazeEmanuar), recently featured on [IGN](https://open.lbry.io/@IGNonLBRY) for his [Super Mario 64 Online mod](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/13/fan-made-super-mario-64-brings-online-play), has made a habit of taking arguably the most revolutionary game of the most iconic franchise in history and fusing it to the modern day, in all its blocky glory.

Words don't do this madman justice. Feast your eyes on Super Mario 64 graphed onto the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time overworld.
