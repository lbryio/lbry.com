Mainstream news can be agonizingly dry at best and dishonest at worst.

But when your life doesn't depend on ratings and ad dollars, all of a sudden, news gets real again. So real that you can rap it. Or at least this is how I've been informed they watch news Down Under.

Corporate welfare, crony oil, coral reef decay, and other C-words like Corrupt Politicians and Corrupter McCorruptisons, no sin goes unscathed in the most real news satire on the web. The Juice Media, while covering plenty of news for local Aussies, has probably nailed a world leader in your area with a bad Yelp review at least once.
