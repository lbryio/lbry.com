It always bears repeating around here: LBRY's destiny is nothing short of the most reliable and rich library on earth... despite the illegible abbreviation "LBRY."

To expedite the process, we have [an open bounty](https://lbry.io/bounty/publish-open-content) for the world's free and digitized libraries in order to aggregate them onto one big (decentralized) shelf: LBRY's network of gracious content hosts.

One pierre1024, a member of the [LBRY Chat community](http://chat.lbry.io), has claimed quite a big fish...

![Project Gutenberg](/img/news/gutenberg-inline.jpg)

Project Gutenberg is an open project that has digitized 54,000 free pdf, epub and Kindle books.

Hundreds of historical archives are now available on LBRY, including:

- The Economic Consequences of the Peace by Keynes
- A Soldier's Sketches Under Fire by Harold Harvey
- Journal of a Voyage to Brazil by Callcott
- How Jerusalem Was Won by W. T.  Massey
- Political Thought in England from Locke to Bentham

The project was started by the late Michael Hart in 1971 with the digitization of the US Declaration of Independence. Make a donation [to Project Gutenberg here](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Project_Gutenberg_Needs_Your_Donation), and enjoy thousands of books now available on LBRY.
