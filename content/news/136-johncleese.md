And now, the moment you've all been waiting for...

It's coming, any minute now.

...I see it! Thar she blows, it's The Moment! Don't miss it, it's passing!

The legend, the myth, the tall man: [@JohnCleese](https://open.lbry.io/%40JohnCleese) has joined LBRY. From *Fawlty Towers* and Monty Python to the objective best James Bond films starring John Cleese and Pierce Brosnan, to my personal favorite film of all-time, *Rat Race*, Mr. Cleese's comedic brilliance has graced every corner of entertainment for decades.

You can see John on tour right now [across the United States](http://www.montypython.com/news_jchg2017/422).

Skeptical? Fear not. Proof!
