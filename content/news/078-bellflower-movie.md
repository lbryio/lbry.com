When we say LBRY challenges the Netflix and iTunes of the world, we don't mean it lightly.

That journey began when [Oscilloscope Laboratories](http://www.oscilloscope.net) took the LBRY leap of faith with its darkly comic [*It's A Disaster*](https://open.lbry.io/itsadisaster), starring David Cross and Julia Stiles. You've been streaming it almost daily since our July 4th launch.

Today, Oscilloscope builds on that foundation.

Reintroducing the 2011 cult hit *Bellflower*, out now on LBRY.

> Possibly represents the debut of a one-of-a-kind filmmaker, a natural driven by wild energy, like Tarantino.

> A turbo-charged indictment of male adolescent fantasy and a biting critique of misplaced machismo. A burnt-out, bloody, brave debut...

Each month through 2016, a new Oscilloscope film will land on LBRY. Next month, look for some special Black Friday deals with a dash of Sci-Fi in time for Thanksgiving.
