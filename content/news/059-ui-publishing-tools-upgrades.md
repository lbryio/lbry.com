Content publishers can now use a new feature called Reflector to upload files to LBRY, providing an easier, friendlier, and more permanent publishing experience. This coincides with a beautiful update to our user-interface – a big upgrade to the look and functionality of LBRY's front-end:

LBRY [publishing tools came online](https://lbry.io/news/publish-tools-live-earn-1000-dollars) in the first week of August, but we found a significant number of people still had trouble publishing. Reflector fixes these problems with a more robust form of publishing.

Basically, Reflector ensures content is copied by other hosts before the data is ever requested by a user. Since this initial data is not paid for by the recipients, we want to be clear – *Reflector is non-mandatory.*

This feature is intended as a workaround for network and firewall issues.
