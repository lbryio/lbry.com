In case you've missed it, we're launching the [LBRY Beta](https://lbry.io/get?auto=1) on Android next Monday.

We believe information should be freely accessible by everyone. We want everyone to be able to access the content they care about without middlemen.

We want you to be able to do it how you prefer to - and that is overwhelmingly on mobile devices.

A big piece of executing on this mission is through building software that is open source. We deploy the LBRY software on [GitHub](https://github.com/lbryio) publicly, the LBRY website code can be seen (and changes made) by you on [GitHub](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry.io), and we are happy to have the best user community the internet has ever seen!

Which is all a long winded way of saying we specifically chose Android because it is inherently more open in nature. Go crack your Android phone, its fine. You probably already have. Why wouldn't you? It is your phone. You own it.

We take every opportunity to support open source development, higher functioning user experience, and limiting control of centralized entities.

Knowing all of this, is there any other mobile operating system we could start with?

There is only Android.

We want LBRY to be in the hands of people who are advanced users, people who have technologically sophisticated taste, and people who are willing to help build the type of future that the Android platform has at its core.

By downloading the [LBRY Beta](https://lbry.io/get?auto=1) you will be using an app that, at times, crashes. At times it will load slowly.

You will also be fueling a new paradigm in technology and power.

And make no mistake, there are very powerful people who want this to fail.

So to all the Android users out there...

Welcome to LBRY.
