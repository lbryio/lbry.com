## Here’s the Buzz About LBRY's Swarm Program 

LBRY’s community contains thousands of members spread across around the world working on important tasks like translations, alternative apps, and spreading meme love.

![Become the Swarm](https://spee.ch/@lbrynews:0/queen-of-beeso3074769.jpg)

Today, we’re announcing the formalization of this assuredly not black-tie program.

### What is it and how does it work?

The LBRY Swarm is a community program to promote awareness, use, and development of the LBRY protocol and network through the creation of "Hives." We believe in empowering people across the globe to be able to promote and monetize their content and regain control from corporate-controlled centralized platforms.

A Hive is made up of people who care about LBRY and… something else. That “something else” could be based on many different ideas. Some good examples: a geographical area, a genre of music, a hobby or interest, or a project being built on the LBRY protocol.

If you’re interested in finding out more about the Swarm program, how to start a hive, or join one, [please check out this link.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDabPptaLx7TI7DeT_dAOZgeulSRD1A-VnYYypbuc_r4wlhA/viewform?usp=sf_link) We have a discussion list for all, plus all are welcome in our Swarm Discord. 

### Are there any particularly needed Hives?

Some ideas for hive interest areas that have come up but do not have a firm group supporting them are:

* Fine Art
* Photography
* Fan Art (think DeviantArt)
* Science topics
* Craft How-tos
* Life Hacks/How-tos
* News
* Free Speech
* Activism
* Environment
* Arabic
* French
* 3D Printing
* Gaming

If you’re interested in one of the above areas, you should come [join our chat right now and let us know](https://lbry.social)! Or if you’re not ready for that level of commitment, you can [email us](mailto:hello@lbry.com).

### What existing Hives can I join?

While many hives are formed based on a geographic location, some hives have general interests and meet virtually. If you want to learn what the Swarm is all about, joining one of these hives is a great place to start! Or, if you'd like, you can [view our regional hives here.](#regional)
