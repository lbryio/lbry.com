LBRY is more than a digital entertainment outlet. A key motivation behind LBRY was enabling global access to lessons from the masters of their craft. We want to share content that empowers everyone to raise the bar.

We're starting that trend this week with [Character Design Forge, AKA Brookes Eggleston](http://brookeseggleston.com). Arguably the most important element of storytelling is strong characters. Brookes gives illustrators the tools they need to start their stories off on the right foot.
