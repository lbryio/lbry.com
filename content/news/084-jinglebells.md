Another month, another holiday. And not just any holiday... this one has theme songs.

So, to expand your Christmas music palette, we bring you: [*Jingle Bell Rocks*](https://open.lbry.io/jinglebellrocks).

The seedy underbelly of the Christmas music world is your ticket to freedom from dreadful, ear-splitting Christmas tropes of old. You don't have to suffer! There is a better song out there!

*Jingle Bell Rocks* is a can't miss, one-of-a-kind documentary.
