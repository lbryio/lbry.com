*Hi everybody, this is Reilly with LBRY, hope you're doing well...*

LBRY has its roots in freedom and liberty: say, publish, and share your mind without fear of censorship, persecution, or an authority breathing down your neck. The rise of alternative radio shows and podcasters has been a boon to the expression of liberty and non-mainstream media.

We tip our hat to the liberty movement and welcome two of the biggest podcasts to LBRY.

**Freedomain Radio**

Stefan Molyneux's Freedomain Radio has grown from a part-time podcast to a full-fledged, daily radio show with millions of monthly downloads and views. Interviews with leading economists, academics, authors along with a hard-hitting philosophical analysis of current events make Freedomain Radio the essential counter-culture podcast.

**The Schiff Report**

Known for his [bold predictions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfascZSTU4o) of the 2008 financial crisis coming true and subsequent market corrections – CNBC even [admitted it after the fact!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sie11QXI_Q) – Peter Schiff is a successful financial advisor and radio host outside the traditional Wall Street beltway. Author of several books, including my personal favorite, "The Little Book of Bull Moves in Bear Markets", his financial opines will seldom tow the party line.
