You might be thinking, "It's a great day to spend my hard-earned LBC on some Mary Jane."

Nah.

You know what gets us lit on 4/20? The first music videos on LBRY, courtesy of *capital* AKA Tyler Moore AKA the most real dude in the Los Angeles music scene.

Mr. Moore's tunes are a new personal favorite of mine. His freshman EP, *Winning for Losing*, sounds like the working man's Shwayze with better beats. If your nine-to-five's got you down, *capital* has your back. I mean, he can't help you out or nothing... but this song is pretty relatable, and a dope way to spend three minutes on LBRY.

Two videos, directed by Angelino filmmaker Johnny Sikma, can be found at:

"Wasted"

"Pillsbury Boy"

(That's right. LBRY has channels now. But the only way to try 'em out before May is to hangout with us on [Discord chat](http://chat.lbry.io). Claim your @name on the revamped Publish page, manage each channel, and what content belongs where.)
