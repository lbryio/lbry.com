_Hello..._
_Allow me to introduce myself... My name is, lbry.tech_
_It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time... Sorry it took so long..._
_My name is, lbry.tech... We never meant to leave you...  without documentation_

Enough with the parodies. This post is _serious_.

*Assumes deep Hollywood blockbuster movie trailer voice.*

In a world where most blockchain companies create psuedo-scientific whitepapers that more resemble an investment prospectus...

In a world where even Bitcoin says the primary documentation is the code...

One company was brave enough - bold enough - to create a true technical resource.

[lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech) is our new comprehensive web portal for technical users. If sentences containing words and phrases like Merkle tree, activation delay, and manifest blob are the things that you find interesting, this is the website for you.

### What is lbry.tech?

[lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech) contains technical resources, a protocol specification, API documentation, and more. 

Here are some of the things you can find on lbry.tech:

- [LBRY Protocol Specification](https://lbry.tech/spec) - A comprehensive, thorough documentation of _exactly_ what LBRY is and how it works. We've called this a spec rather than a whitepaper because that's what it is. It's not a theoretical proposal, but a detailed description of a system in production usage.

- [LBRY Overview](https://lbry.tech/overview) - An introduction and interactive overview of LBRY specifically for technical users.

- [The Playground](https://lbry.tech/playground) - An interactive utility that helps engineers understand what LBRY is and how it works with real-world examples.

- [Contributor's Guide](https://lbry.tech/contribute) - Everything a would-be contributor needs to know to contribute to LBRY. Whether you're a front-end developer, a low-level micro-optimizer, or something in between, there's a way to help out.

- [SDK APIs](https://lbry.tech/api/sdk) and [Blockchain APIs](https://lbry.tech/api/blockchain) - Formerly on lbry.com, these useful resources have been updated and redesigned.

- [Builders's Guide](https://lbry.tech/build) - A new resource specifically for those who want to build their own app or utility using the LBRY protocol, rather than contribute to LBRY Inc. projects.

- [Developer Reward Program](https://lbry.tech/developer-program) - A new reward program specifically for developers to help them get started learning, contributing, or building with LBRY.

But that's not all! See everything for yourself at [lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech).
