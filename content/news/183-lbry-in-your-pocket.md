We’re extremely excited to announce the release of our Android app! We’ve moved the project into “open beta” status, which means that while there’s still a lot of work to do, you can [install the app on your device now](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lbry.browser) and access the LBRY content network!

CAUTION!

TO BE CLEAR, this is not the finished product. There’s still a significant wait before videos begin to play (15 to 20 seconds seems typical), and we’re working on a number of features to unify the user experience between the desktop app and mobile app. 

In a nutshell, here’s what’s in the app and what’s missing:

We’re working on it:

* Publishing
* Subscriptions
* ShapeShift integration
*  History
* Wallet Features
  * Wallet encryption
  * Wallet sync

In the app:
* Everything else!

Ultimately, we want to offer a seamless transition between mobile and desktop, but right now, we’re still figuring out some important features (like wallet sync) that will make that possible. Our sometimes-crazy commitment to decentralizing all the things can mean that we have to put in extra time on problems that centralized services deal with easily, but we’re confident that you’ll be happy with the end result.

In the meantime, please unleash hell on this app! We need it to be forged and honed in the hot fires of your criticism and bug reports. But don’t be too mean - you don’t want to make Akinwale sad, do you?
