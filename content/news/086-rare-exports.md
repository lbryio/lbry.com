Since it's still December, we decided another Christmas flick was in order.

Oscilloscope presents their second ode to St. Nick this month on LBRY: [*Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale*](https://open.lbry.io/rareexports).

From Finnish director Jalmari Helander comes the twisted story of the biggest Christmas secret of all. The answer has nothing to do with Jesus.

> "Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale" is a rather brilliant lump of coal for your stocking hung by the fireside with care. How else to explain an R-rated Santa Claus origin story crossed with "The Thing" (1982)?

Merry Christmas to everyone who tried out LBRY in 2016. It's been a pleasure.
