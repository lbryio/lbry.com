The tenets of FEE, or the Foundation for Economic Education, are pretty similar to our own: to inspire, educate and connect.

Every video available via <a href='lbry://@FEEOrg'>@FEEOrg</a> consistently lives up to these ideals.

Behind all of the fancy and often breathtaking technology that powers LBRY, it is easy to forget that ultimately, it all comes back down to the same ideas that help one decide what food to buy, which flowers to get your spouse, or where you want to live.

1) Do I like it?
2) What will I pay for it?

<a href='lbry://@FEEOrg'>@FEEOrg</a> takes simple economic ideas and applies them to big problems with incredible results.

If the economics of the LBRY world fascinate you, I highly recommend you check out everything this great channel has to offer.
