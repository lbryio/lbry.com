The [LBRY.fund](https://lbry.fund) is a pool of LBC Credits set aside for promoting community development on the LBRY protocol. The fund is open to anybody, and you can submit requests for your ideas using, developing, or promoting use of the LBRY protocol, We're proud to share some of the projects we've funded.

#### FONK World:
Our friends David Heath and Mike Little have been hard at work putting the final touches on an humorous animated video guide to LBRY called "FONKn' LBRY." The animation is intended to appeal to a larger audience and explain the workings of the LBRY protocol in a whimsical way.

#### LBRY Pi TV:
While our Dev team has been focused on bringing LBRY to small screens, [Discord](https://chat.lbry.io) user Madiator2011 has been working a plug and play device to view LBRY video content on television. At its core, the device uses a Raspberry Pi computer to stream LBRY videos. You can download the most recent version of [LBRY Pi TV here.](https://lbrypi.com/downloads).

#### Matt Sokol's _The Book Boutique_
Musician and LBRY contributor Matt Sokol approached us with a unique LBRY.fund request: he asked us to fund him to work on a special project using a custom [Spee.ch Multisite](https://github.com/lbryio/spee.ch) installation to host beautifully typeset classical books. The first book he is working on is the classic, _Siddhartha._ Meanwhile, if you'd like to hear some of Matt's music, you can find it on the LBRY app: [lbry://@heymattsokol.](https://open.lbry.io/@heymattsokol)

### Roadmap Check-in {#roadmap}
We've passed a major milestone on our [roadmap](https://lbry.io/roadmap) with the release of the LBRY mobile app to open beta! We've also implemented wallet encryption inside the LBRY Desktop app and significantly improved content hosting - two more items checked off the list. We'll most likely need to shuffle around some of the other scheduled items based on new priorities and current workload, so stay tuned for an update in next month's community report.

### LBRY is hiring!

During the past month a lot of work was put in Youtube Sync to increase performance. After dealing with issues related to the quality of the streams and the tracking of our content we achieved another milestone by publishing another 100k videos. We are now close to 200k videos published through our YouTube synch program.

The current queue will add an additional 132k videos and 1500 channels.
The system is now automatically syncing new channels and keeping all the previously synced channels up to date with the content posted on YouTube. Within 24 hours of publishing to youtube, a content creator will find their video on LBRY as well.

During the next month we expect to be clearing up the whole backlog, additionally all the UC Berkeley content will be restored on LBRY!

# Want to develop on the LBRY protocol?
All of our code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lbryio). Are you a developer and want to find out more? Check out our [general contributing guide](https://lbry.io/faq/contributing) and our LBRY App specific contributing [document](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please be patient with us while we improve our technical documentation. In the next few weeks we'll be releasing [lbry.tech](#lbry-tech), a technical reference / guide website which will be developer and contributor focused to drive more apps and services on top of LBRY.
