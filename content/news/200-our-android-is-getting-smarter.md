We need your feedback to get LBRY for Android ready for prime time - [head to this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lbry.browser) on your mobile device to try it out, and let us know what you think on [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lbrycom)! 

If you’re a developer and want to dive a bit deeper into the process, take a look at the [release notes here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android/releases/tag/0.4.0) or jump right into our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/lbryio/).

Thanks for helping us build the decentralized internet of the future - we can’t do it without you!
