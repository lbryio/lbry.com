You're visiting Singapore in 2050.

Instead of seeing towering cranes dragging and dropping giant steel beams, you see a 3D printer towering over a construction site as it manufacturers a skyscraper layer by layer, with artificial intelligence manning the unmanned printer.

 

Is this even possible? Definitely. We're already printing out habitats for ourselves as a species. Companies like Printhuest from Denmark are creating construction printers, like the [BOD2](https://3dprinthuset.dk/3d-construction-printer/).

3D printing high rises is just a more grandiose application, but one which we can expect to happen if the technology keeps accelerating at an exponential pace.

 

What in the hell does this futuristic scene have to do with blockchain? The answer: a whole lot more than you'd think.

 

The value of LBRY lies in the fact that creators of digital content can sell their files directly to the users of those files without a third party. What's the application in this context?

 

Well, a building has many facets: its structure, its windows, its interior, its d√©cor, its lighting, its flooring, its walls, etc. You can make a long list of components; the point is that each of these components must be designed. Over time, the number of componenets in the building that have unprintable parts will fall. This will enable the digitzation of almost all physical objects we surround ourselves with into .gcode (geometric code: what 3D printers read).

 

Designers could specialize in making various elements of the building. One designer might specialize in elegant stained glass creations, while another might specialize in crafty lamp and chandelier designs.

 

Together, these content creators of various building elements can enable architects to co-create buildings with the specialists, enabling intricacies previously unimaginable due to the extreme specialization at play.

 

This does beg some questions: how do we know if the window specialist and the lighting specialist can design window and lamp implementations that successfully coexist in the same space? Why would we want a bunch of component specific architects in the first place? Couldn't one architect easily do a better job at making everything match?

 

These are rational concerns. Why would an architect want to purchase all the components of a building he's designing when he could just design each component from scratch to ensure aesthetic compatibility? The architect can use components for inspiration and work with the component specialists to ensure holistic integration of designs.

 

Let's go back a years to when this skycraper in Singapore was being designed by an architect named Satoshi. He's finished most of the building but needs to add the lighting and windows, so he hops onto an architecture specific application of the LBRY protocol, RCHTCTR, to shop for some components. 

 

Playing around with the window designs, he's able to find the perfect match, so he pays the window designer .01 LBC ($100 at 2050 prices). Now he looks for a lamp designer. He struggles to find one that fits the aesthetic. However, he finds one a chandelier design that is pretty close, only the general shape is an equilateral triangle, not the aesthetically required isosceles.

 

Well, what he can do is make a purchase-contingency, where he sends some LBC to the creator with a request to adapt the equilateral design to his building's isocelic requirements. The architect can withdrawal his request at any time, and his reputation for withdrawals will appear on the blockchain so that he can't waste too many designers' time. 

 

The lighting designer inspects the building file and gets a sense of the aesthetic before adapting his chandelier design to the aesthetic specificities of the building. Once the isoscelic file is approved by Satoshi, the designer gets paid.

 

The skyscraper now has the ideal set of components, even though they weren't all originally one person's idea. Satoshi was able to co-create with other designers who sell 3D printable building files in order to construct a master file that the printer read holistically, and printed magnificently before your eyes.

This is obviously a futuristic application of LBRY, and yet the value the protocol provides is clear: creators can specilaize and transact with other creators (like Satoshi) independent of a corporate giant, only dependent on the decentralized LBRY protocol.
