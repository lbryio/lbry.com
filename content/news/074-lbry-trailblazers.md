The core innovations of LBRY are built upon a simple idea: connect the audience to the creator, anywhere on Earth, in one smooth motion.

Since our July 4th launch, the team has leapt forward again and again toward that goal.

But there's one key ingredient that makes this train keep chugging along: content. What kinds of work you publish and don't publish; what you like to watch, listen and read: you help define the experience of LBRY.

We have a lot of surprises on the horizon. Even some LBRY exclusives! And publishers like Oscilloscope Pictures are pleased that you loved *It's a Disaster*, and they want to bring some more gems out of the vault to share.

Today, we're reflecting on the trail blazed so far. It takes guts to share content dear to your heart in a risky, unproven way. These publishers have helped carry LBRY toward its ambitious goal.

We salute them. And then we enjoy them.
