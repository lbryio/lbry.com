This week, we're keeping it short and sweet with LBRY's first short film: *SKATE YRSELF CLEAN*.

Los Angeles-based actor-director Janna Jude paints a loving portrait of one Ricky Lee Robinson in her first documentary film.

Part biography, part LCD Soundsystem music video, *SKATE* captures the American dream—and its obstacles—through the intimate character lens of a Floridian freestyle roller skater. He owns a floor cleaning business by day, shreds up the rink by night, and charms your pants off 24/7.

> "I'd like to be buried with my skates on, definitely. Or laying beside me somewhere, you know, in the casket... put a burger in my hand and my roller skates on and... bury me." **- Ricky Lee Robinson**

Janna's six-minute short won the Grand Jury Prize at [Florida Film Festival for Best Short Doc](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-05-01/entertainment/os-florida-film-festival-winners-20130501_1_florida-film-festival-award-winners-audience-award), as well as being selected by [Nashville Film Festival](https://nashvillefilmfestival.org/news/full-short-film-lineup) and [DOC NYC](http://www.docnyc.net/film/obsessions).
