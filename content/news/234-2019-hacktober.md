We had dozens of quashed bugs and usability improvements, as well as major contributions like a refactored exchange rate manager, rich comment previews, automatic language detection, and more.

In addition to LBC bonuses, contributors will be getting a shirt featuring this sweet logo:

This year’s Hacktoberfest included several live coding intro sessions with our CEO, Jeremy Kauffman. Because of the success of these events, we’ve decided to continue offering these sessions monthly! For notifications of these events and other developer-centric updates, enter your email address in the footer of lbry.tech.

The fun doesn't have to stop just because October is over - if you're inspired to contribute to the LBRY project, you can get started right away via the LBRY Contributor’s Guide.


Thanks to our community for helping us build the future of content freedom - we can't do this without you!
