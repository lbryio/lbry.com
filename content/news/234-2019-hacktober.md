We had dozens of quashed bugs and usability improvements, as well as major contributions like a refactored exchange rate manager, rich comment previews, automatic language detection, and more.

In addition to LBC bonuses, contributors will be getting a shirt featuring this sweet logo:

The fun doesn't have to stop just because October is over - if you're inspired to contribute to the LBRY project, you can get started right away via the LBRY Contributor’s Guide.


Thanks to our community for helping us build the future of content freedom - we can't do this without you!
