It's fall and...

*Hoot hoot!*

Do you hear that? Is it an owl?

Actually, it’s people expressing their excitement about this year’s Hacktoberfest!

Every October, LBRY and many other open-source companies make a special effort to welcome new contributors. Throughout the month, we’ll be guiding new contributors, hosting information sessions and events, and giving out some sweet swag and rewards to those who participate.

## How To Participate

If you’re a developer that is comfortable working in Python, C++, JavaScript, or HTML/CSS, there’s plenty to be done from big to small.

If you are a capable reader (and if you’re a developer, we cannot recommend this skill strongly enough), our [contributor’s guide](https://lbry.tech/contribute) outlines existing LBRY repos, languages, and how to get started.

For Hacktoberfest specifically, we’ve focused on making sure there are newcomer-friendly issues for the following repos:

| Repo | Language | Description | Hacktoberfest Issues
--- | --- | --- | ---
| [lbrycrd](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) | C++ | The LBRY blockchain daemon. | [Issues](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest)  
| [lbry-sdk](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) | Python | The SDK used by most LBRY apps, includes SPV wallet, data network, and more. | [Issues](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest)
| [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) | JavaScript (React) | The official desktop client and soon-to-be lbry.tv frontend. | [Issues](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest)
| [lbry-android](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android) | JavaScript (React) | The official Android browser. | [Issues](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest)


All of the above repos have user-friendly READMEs to get up and running because around here we’ve got [standards](https://lbry.tech/resources/repository-standards). And if you’re looking for some personal help, you can [join our chat](https://chat.lbry.com/), post on [our forum](http://forum.lbry.tech/), or join a [live session](#events).

Note: the chat link goes to LBRY’s main public chat. Post a message in binary* to let everyone know you are a developer and you will be whisked away to secret lairs.

*You don’t have to do this and as far as I know no one ever has, but it would presumably work.

## Swagtoberfest and Token Giveaways

Anyone who makes any contribution at all, even a one line typo fix, will receive a LBRY sticker.

Anyone who contributes anything of any substance* will receive a sticker, LBRY t-shirt, and more.

And as always, anyone who contributes will receive LBC as [appreciation](https://lbry.com/faq/appreciation).

Additionally, this month only, every contributor, new or returning, will receive a 10,000 LBC bonus for their first PR of this month.

T-shirts and stickers will be the above Hacktoberfest image.

*We’re going to be very inclusive as counting PRs as substantive, but due to some people making drive-by PRs to earn shirts, we’ve introduced this additional qualifier.

## <a name="events"></a>Events

This year, we’ll be hosting several live video sessions.

If you want to live help with screen sharing and extended demos, you can join these sessions during the hours listed. A LBRY developer will be there, waiting, lurking, and just when you least expect it… will answer your questions politely and promptly.

Video sessions will happen on the following dates and times:

- Thursday, October 3rd, 18:00-22:00 UTC
- Sunday, October 13th, 15:00-19:00 UTC
- Tuesday, October 29nd, 20:00-24:00 UTC

For all sessions, visit [lbry.com/doitlive](https://lbry.com/doitlive). This link may not function until shortly before each event.

## Developer Credits Program

New developers with valid GitHub accounts can receive 100 LBC for testing and getting started. You can claim that [here](https://lbry.tech/developer-program).
