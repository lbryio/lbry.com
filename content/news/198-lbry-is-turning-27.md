LBRY v0.27.0 is coming in hot with a whole new look! We've completed our redesign of the app - you can get a preview of our new look in the GIF below. Along with a faster, more stable network courtesy of [LBRY SDK 0.30.4](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/releases/tag/v0.30.4), v0.27.0 includes a number of minor bug fixes and streamlines email verification. You can get all the gritty details [here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/releases/tag/v0.27.0).
