LBRY is kicking off #MovieTuesday with the critically acclaimed **Howl**, a biopic that brings Allen Ginsberg's obscenity trial to surreal life with animated sequences and powerful performances from James Franco, Jon Hamm, and Jeff Daniels.

Join us on our [Discord #general channel](http://chat.lbry.com) when we press play at 8 PM ET tonight (11/28) to watch along with the LBRY team, provide an in-deep critical explanation, and maybe harass a bit.

Use [this link](https://open.lbry.com/howl-lbry-movie-night) to watch **Howl** in the LBRY app.

See you at the movies!
