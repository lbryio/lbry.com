In the film business, there's an annual party in the mountains to celebrate independent film and kick off the new year in movies.

The 2017 edition begins today.

You know it as the Sundance Film Festival. It has given a voice to many young filmmakers over the years: Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith, Richard Linklater, Wes Anderson, the Coen brothers, Robert Rodriguez, Errol Morris, Cary Fukunaga, Damien Chazelle Ryan Coogler...

Luckily, we have LBRY, which is way cheaper than booking a hotel in Park City.

[Our October film BELLFLOWER](https://lbry.io/news/bellflower-movie), from Oscilloscope Labs, had its 2011 debut at Sundance. (Watch it at lbry://bellflower) In fact, the O-scope crew is probably walking into the next great LBRY gem right this moment at [the Egyptian](https://www.visitparkcity.com/listing/egyptian-theatre/15000)...

A year after BELLFLOWER, yours truly (read: me) attended Sundance for the first time...

> Little seven-year-old, Petey, falls prey to his older brothers' hellion ways.

This little six-minute gem directed by Kat Candler went on to play 40 film festivals and two years later was adapted into a [feature film starring Aaron Paul and Juliette Lewis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3186318). See it at lbry://hellion

Without *Hellion* and our [November film *Cinema Six*](https://lbry.io/news/singletree), I would not be here today with LBRY. So here's to keeping the dream of great indie film alive.
