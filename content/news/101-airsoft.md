One of the biggest perks of the early days of LBRY continues to be the discovery of content creators that never even occurred to me as a thing.

A niche stumbles into our inbox (this time with the [LBRY-YouTube sync tool here](https://lbry.io/youtube)) and what you *thought* was a niche reveals itself as an entire world to explore.

We're going off the grid and the rails. Gear up, soldier, and enter Amped Airsoft.

Amped Airsoft has one of the largest channels dedicated to the sport.

Imagine real-life Call of Duty warfare waged with non-lethal force on the forest moon of Endor. And Amped Airsoft videos give you a frontline POV-style look at the battlefield.

Amped also publishes countless reviews of gear for your squadron, available [on their website](https://ampedairsoft.com) for purchase.
