### We Accomplished What The Physicists Couldn’t: Unification

Today, LBRY is announcing a dual release: [LBRY Heisenberg](#desktop) (for Windows, macOS, and Linux) and [LBRY Cartwheel](#android) (for Android). You can read more about each below, but the biggest change spreads across both:

You can now sync _everything_ about your LBRY experience across all LBRY apps!

This is an absolute revolution in your LBRY experience. If you sign in, you can now have your balance, channels, subscriptions, followed tags, and more stay consistent across devices. If you uninstall LBRY, everything will still be there for you when you come back.

This brings the LBRY user-experience much closer to that of traditional centralized platforms in terms of the ability to simply sign in and have everything be just where it was when you were last using it. And we do this without the downsides of centralized platforms: you are still the only one with access to your keys and the only one who can make changes to your account. For more on this, check out the  [Account Sync FAQ](https://lbry.com/faq/account-sync).

Each release contains a number of separate improvements as well, which are explained in more detail below.
