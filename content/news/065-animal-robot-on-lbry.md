New week, new subwoofer. We're so excited to share this artist with you on LBRY.

Introducing, [AnimalRobot](https://www.facebook.com/animalrobot). Their work has won a Webby award and has been featured on @Time, @HuffingtonPost, @Slate, @VICE, @nerdist, @peoplemag, @MTV & more. This is a one-of-a-kind artist who has perfected the art of audio-visual mash up.

First out the gate: if you're feeling nostalgic for [Los Santos](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Los_Santos_(HD_Universe)), [Franklin](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Franklin_Clinton) is here to bring you back to his roots.

And in the LBRY sequel to HeckBender's *Pug Rap God* (lbry://pugrapgod), AnimalRobot steps up the rap god game with his mad masterpiece, *Rick and Morty + Rap God*. You've never heard Rick spit like this before.
