The grand goal of building the ultimate online library must start with the ultimate free library already in existence: the public domain.

We're kicking off a trend of LBRY being the number one place to find top public domain content on the planet. It starts with the original Max Fleischer Superman cartoons.

**<p align="center">Re-introducing Superman, from the original 1940s serial cartoons.</p>**

> A total of seventeen shorts were produced. They were originally produced by [Fleischer Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleischer_Studios), releasing the pilot and eight cartoons in 1941 and 1942 before being taken over in May by [Famous Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Studios), a successor company, who produced eight more in 1942 and 1943. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1940s_cartoons))
