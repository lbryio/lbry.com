#### Video Player and Download Settings

The new video player fixes a number of bugs and includes new features like volume control, ability to play more video codecs, and you can also skip anywhere in the video instantly. 

Did you say you don't want to download every video? We heard your feedback! There are two new settings for saving hosted content and files. Users who wish to disable either or both can do so.

#### LBRY.tv {#web}

Over the last few months, we‚Äôve been running a view-only pilot of [beta.lbry.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv), meaning you can view free content, but many of the other features like wallets, rewards, and publishing have been disabled. 

We also added some tags so when you share a LBRY file on social media such as Twitter or Facebook, you will see a preview and description of the actual content instead of a generic LBRY image.

#### LBRY for Android {#android}

Announcing the release of Butterfly! Since our last update, the Android app has been playing catchup with the Desktop app‚Äôs discovery features - this includes the ability to follow tags and explore tags, create channels, and publish (and edit!) content. We‚Äôre also excited that some of the more profound performance problems with the Android app have been resolved. The publish process now includes automatic uploading of thumbnails, and you can also tag your content, create a channel, select a URL, and adjust your default LBC bid. 

All of the [details of the latest release are here.](https://lbry.com/news/butterfly-flits-onto-the-scene)

#### New Daily Rewards! {#rewards}

Weekly rewards tied to the LBRYCast email have gone away, but now you can earn even more LBC with the new daily watch rewards! Each day you watch a video, you'll receive a random award of between 1 and 100 LBC. Enjoy! 

### Hacktoberfest is Here! {#hacktoberfest}

As an Open Source company, LBRY is excited to participate in Hacktoberfest again this year! Submit Pull Requests to our Github project repos to earn a brand new limited-edition collectible LBRY Hacktoberfest t-shirt and other swag.

### We're recruiting for existing and new hives! {#new}

The LBRY Swarm is a community program to promote awareness, use, and development of the LBRY protocol and network. We believe in empowering people across the globe to be able to promote and monetize their content and regain control from corporate-controlled centralized platforms.

We need your help to grow the Swarm program. There are a number of potential hive focus areas, and we're interested in new hives or for existing hives to curate content in these areas:

* Fine Art
* Photography
* Fan Art (think DeviantArt)
* Science topics
* Craft How-tos
* Life Hacks/How-tos
* News
* Free Speech
* Activism
* Environment
* Arabic
* French
* Gaming
