### It's hard to say when it started, but as the years march on the once wild and free plains of the web have gotten cramped, provincial, and dare we say it, boring.

In a world where holding the wrong opinion can get you doxxed, dismissed, and demonetized, some people have decided to just stop talking. Others have embraced the darkness, transforming into chthonic ur-trolls striding across the once lively wasteland. But after you see a troll rampage across someone's feed a few times, it stops being interesting.

The internet is for everyone, from timid lurkers to blustery blowhards. At LBRY, we want to bring back that energy and enthusiasm that made the internet what it was. That's why we need you to call your representatives today.
