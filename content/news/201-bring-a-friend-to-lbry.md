Head over to [LBRY’s new arcade!](https://open.lbry.com/%40OpenSourceGames) You can now play a number of free, open-source games in-app. We’re still working on this feature, so be on the lookout for more games and a better user experience with the player over the coming months.

If you haven’t opened LBRY on your computer in a while, now’s the time to do it! 

We need your feedback to make LBRY even better - upgrade in-app or [head to this link](/get) to download LBRY now, and let us know what you think on [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lbryio)!
