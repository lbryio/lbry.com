Like many internet technologies, the LBRY network was born not only as a response to economic incentives but as a philosophical and ethical answer to the status quo.

In our case, the status quo are monolithic content distribution giants.

Now and then, some high-level reflection can be a powerful tool. And there is no one better at that than rationality rock star Julia Galef.

Julia Galef's podcast [Rationally Speaking](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org) and vlogs were some of the first content series we sought to share on LBRY.

One of the most critical minds of our day, Julia co-founded the non-profit Center for Applied Rationality in 2012, and has written about rationality and philosophy for *Scientific American*, Slate, *Popular Science*, and more.

Her vlog lectures, covering paradoxes, beliefs, morality, and everything under the philosophical sun, can be found on LBRY at:

(The Rationally Speaking podcast series will also be available @JuliaGalef--as well as other podcasts--when LBRY introduces its native audio player.)
