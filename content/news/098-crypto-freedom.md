Is New Hampshire the best place to run a cryptocurrency business? It already has the highest per-capita Bitcoin usage. And very soon it is likely to have the most favorable regulatory climate.

While states like Hawaii are passing bills [so onerous](http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-just-stopped-serving-bitcoin-hawaii) that Bitcoin might as well be illegal, New Hampshire is passing legislation to completely deregulate cryptocurrencies. [House Bill 436](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/Results.aspx?q=1&txtsessionyear=2017) exempts virtual currencies from all state regulation. Just minutes ago, it passed the New Hampshire statehouse, 185-170.

LBRY is thrilled to have been a part of this process. As the governor-appointed industry expert on virtual currencies, I'm glad I finally had the chance to give back to a technology that has given so much to me.

However, most of the credit goes to Representatives [Barbara Biggie](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=377207) and [Keith Ammon](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=377204), who introduced the bill, as well as Representative [John Hunt](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=372375), who helped steer it out of committee and defended it on the floor. Additionally, the [Chamber of Digital Commerce](https://digitalchamber.org) gave us invaluable advice and advocated heavily on behalf of the bill.

The battle is not over! If you support this effort, please [let the governor know](https://www.governor.nh.gov/contact/index.htm) and give thanks to the hard work of those mentioned above.
