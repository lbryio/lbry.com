In today's age of fake news, real news, and just plain biased "news," it can be a time-consuming task unto itself finding the true story.

Luckily, this trend has given rise to an era of channels dedicated to covering contemporary events *and mainstream coverage* of the same event. We now live in a time where the diverse ways in which a story is told can become a more interesting story than the events themselves.

1791L provides some top-notch analysis of the topic of the day in a digestible short-documentary style.
