One of our most requested genres of content is the comedy. So we're hitting a few birds with one stone: comedy + podcasts.

The first three podcasts to ever join LBRY are:
- You Should Have Planned Better with Jay Light and Leah Lemarr
- Inappropriate Earl with Earl Skakel
- Why Do You Care?! with Katie Allinson and Will Moyer

Jay, Leah and Earl give a rare insight into the world of rising standup comics. All three are known for their antics on Comedy Central's Roast Battle as professional roasters. Each podcast features candid conversations with up-and-coming comedians in the Los Angeles and New York stand-up scene. If you want to find hidden gems in comedy, they're here.

Katie and Will keep the candid going and add a dash of deep analysis: from why Game of Thrones is a bad show, the history of James Bond, to the structure of storytelling... if you watch it, they beg to differ.
