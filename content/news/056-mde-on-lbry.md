[MillionDollarExtreme (MDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Extreme) is the first comedy series to become a [LBRY publishing partner](https://lbry.io/publish). MDE's classics are being added to LBRY, and you can start with:

- *[Sam Hyde's 2070 Paradigm Shift](lbry://samhyde2070)* – The ultimate TEDx troll; an instant internet classic.
- *[College Cunts](lbry://collegecunts)* – Practical and expertly vulgar advice for would-be college students.

MDE is a comedy sketch group featuring Sam Hyde, Charles Carroll, and Nick Rochefort. Their signature, fast-paced style of random jump-cuts, meaningless text overlays, crude humor, and nonsensical characters pushed boundaries several years ago. Now it's practically internet gospel for cutting-edge satire and comedy.

MDE has since exploded from extremely super humble origins on YouTube to Adult Swim darlings, following in the footsteps of *[Tim & Eric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_%26_Eric)* and *[Wonder Showzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Showzen)*.

In fact, tomorrow night you can catch episode two of their brand new Adult Swim series *[MillionDollarExtreme Presents: World Peace](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/schedule)*. Tune in at 9:15 PM PT on Friday and 12:45 AM PT on Saturday.

**When you're done, check out their O.G. videos.** Look for the following titles on LBRY:

- *[Williamsburg Fashion series](lbry://WilliamsburgFashion1)*
- *[Boston Ross](lbry://BostonRoss)*
- *[IDEAS Man](lbry://IDEASman)*
- *[LA Street Fashion series](lbry://LAstreetFashion1)*
