### LBRY.fund Featured Community Grants and Updates{#lbry-fund}
The [LBRY.fund](https://lbry.fund) is a pool of LBC Credits set aside for promoting community development on the LBRY protocol. The fund is open to anybody, and you can submit requests for your ideas using, developing, or promoting use of the LBRY protocol, We're proud to share some of the projects we've funded.

#### Jelly Beats:
The LBRY protocol is more than just video! Did you know you can host _any kind of file_ on the LBRY network?

Veteran LBRY contributors Baltazar Gomez and Roman Przyby≈Ça are creating a streaming music player based on the LBRY protocol. The first alpha version is impressive, and we're excited to watch as the app is developed to include playlists, favorites, and more.

You can find the source code on Github: [https://github.com/btzr-io/jelly-beats](https://github.com/btzr-io/jelly-beats)

#### Cryptopuzzle with Lucas Abduch
If you've seen videos on the [@juggling channel](lbry://@juggling) you've witnessed Lucas Abduch's impressive and creative videos.

Coming soon, Lucas will unveil a special LBRY based cryptopuzzle where you can win $2500 in LBRY Credits -- but only if you're the first to solve the puzzle!

As Hacktoberfest draws to a close, we couldn't be happier with how it turned out! Thanks so much to all the contributors who made this month so awesome! We had over 40 unique contributors submit 115 pull requests on LBRY's repos alone, and developers from our staff worked on a number of thorny issues for other open source projects.

[Read more about Hacktoberfest activities,](https://lbry.io/news/to-hacktoberfest-and-beyond) and watch new videos from our developers introducing the LBRY SDK and how to develop for LBRY protocol and apps.

### Roadmap Check-in {#roadmap}
We've got a few small updates on on our [roadmap](https://lbry.io/roadmap) before the team revamps a new one for late 2018/2019. In October, the [lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech) technical resource website went live as part of Hacktoberfest, so this delayed Q2 item has been marked complete. With the official release of the 0.30 LBRY protocol completed, the new wallet client is now marked as complete (it will be included in the next app in early November). YouTube sync automation has also been completed as we are now syncing new and existing channels that come in through the [Sync Partner Program](https://lbry.io/youtube). The last step, outside of the actual sync process, is to support sending this synced content to the creators' wallets, which was added to the roadmap under "YouTube Sync Channel Transfer" and to be completed in Q4. Stayed tuned for the next update for the 2019 roadmap revamp!

### YouTube Sync Updates {#YouTube-updates}
In October, we finally caught up with the YouTube sync queue. Over 300K videos have been published through the [program](https://lbry.io/youtube)! The system automatically syncs new channels and keeps previously synced channels up to date with new content posted on YouTube. Within 24 hours of publishing to youtube, a content creator's video will be synced on LBRY as well.

There are two large next steps for this program. First, we need to update all creators' videos with published timestamps in order to match what's on YouTube. This will happen once the LBRY protocol is updated to support this new datapoint (within the next couple months). Second, we need to develop an easy process by which YouTubers will claim their channel and content through the LBRY app, and have it appear in their wallet/My Publishes area so they have full control to edit/delete or post new content exclusively to LBRY.  The sync will continue even after sending over this content.
