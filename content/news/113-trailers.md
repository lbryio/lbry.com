One of my favorite parts of the movie experience is the anticipation. No story is more powerful than the one in your mind's eye. Trailers and teasers play right into that primal feeling.

So, indulge yourself and watch 30 trailers in a row. That's productive, right?

If you've been on the fence about watching [It's a Disaster](https://open.lbry.io/itsadisaster) or [Coherence](https://open.lbry.io/coherence) -- wonder no more. Trailers for current (or upcoming) LBRY movies from [Oscilloscope Labs](http://oscilloscope.net/films), as well as theatrical and video game trailers courtesy of [IGN](http://www.ign.com), are now available as their own channels right on the LBRY homepage, or at:
