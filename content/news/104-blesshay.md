There's only one thing harder than a Dark Souls game: making a Dark Souls game.

But with the renaissance in 16-bit and pixel art-style indie games, there's grown a parallel renaissance in the feasibility of developing your own games as an individual or small team. Tools like GameMaker: Studio, Unity, and Unreal have proliferated to smaller development outfits in recent years.

In the meantime, become the jack-of-all game dev trades at your own pace.
