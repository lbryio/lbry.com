### Richard Harris Says Vote No on Fapping, Yes on Tiny Bits of LSD

[Richard Harris Coaching](https://open.lbry.com/@RichardHarrisCoaching:4) has a lot of life advice to offer, backed up by personal experience, thoughtful self-examination, evidence, and a willingness to experiment.

Where to start with Richard? Well, [his video explaining the benefits of eschewing](http://open.lbry.com/@RichardHarrisCoaching#4/nofap-truth-one-year-of-nofap#6) the ol’ five knuckle shuffle is one of his most popular.

You’re already avoiding ménage à moi? Then perhaps consider a [regular dose of psychedelics](https://open.lbry.com/@RichardHarrisCoaching:4/microdosing-one-year-review:1) - Richard did it for a year!

If that sounds unthinkable, you could shift your [personal Overton window](https://open.lbry.com/@RichardHarrisCoaching:4/personal-growth-series-4-the-overton:1). It’ll change what’s possible for you!

On [his channel](https://open.lbry.com/@RichardHarrisCoaching:4), Richard covers gaming addiction, health tips, dating advice, and more. But be warned, he’s pretty cute. So maybe don’t start with the No Fap one.

(And remember, you can now you get a reward EVERY DAY just for opening up the app and watching something. Don't miss out!)
