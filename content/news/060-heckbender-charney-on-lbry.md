This week, we've added twice as many comedy partners as last week, starting with...

**[Heck Bender](https://www.facebook.com/heckbender)**, the Los Angeles-based sketch comedy channel with nothing to prove.

Their latest sketch premieres exclusively on LBRY! [*The Colorado Bridge Incident*](https://open.lbry.com/coloradobridge:4).

When you're done laughing, watch some of their greats like:

- [*How to Help Non-Sports Fans Enjoy Sports*](https://open.lbry.com/smallpenis:b) – A new medication to help with those times when your buddies are really into the big game, but you? You just aren't...
- [*Eminem - Rap God (Unofficial Pug Edition)*](https://open.lbry.com/pugrapgod:3) – It's Eminem. In top Pug form.
- [*True Christmas*](https://open.lbry.com/truechristmas:c) – Rust and Marty from HBO's True Detective are in fact Santa and his top Elf, unraveling the mystery of the half-eaten cookie plate.

**[Charney Comedy](https://www.facebook.com/charneycomedy)**

A whole 'nother brand of Los Angeles comedy, Charney specializes in the art of the parody. Check out the top notes:

- [*Lenders' Den (Shark Tank)*](https://open.lbry.com/LendersDen:f) – America's most addicting reality sensation is back and BIGGER THAN EVER!
- [*Moneyweasel (Moneyball)*](https://open.lbry.com/moneyweasel:c) – The Los Angeles Snards have a new backdoorsman in left shield, in this recreation of the scene from Moneyball wherein no one still knows what was said.
- [*Loose Cannon (Reservoir Dogs)*](https://open.lbry.com/LooseCannon:7) – One last job, just like old times. Then they're on the next flight to Bora-Bora. ;^)
