This week, we've added twice as many comedy partners as last week, starting with...

**[Heck Bender](https://www.facebook.com/heckbender)**, the Los Angeles-based sketch comedy channel with nothing to prove.

Their latest sketch premieres exclusively on LBRY! [*The Colorado Bridge Incident*](lbry://coloradobridge).

When you're done laughing, watch some of their greats like:

- [*How to Help Non-Sports Fans Enjoy Sports*](lbry://smallpenis) – A new medication to help with those times when your buddies are really into the big game, but you? You just aren't...
- [*Eminem - Rap God (Unofficial Pug Edition)*](lbry://pugrapgod) – It's Eminem. In top Pug form.
- [*True Christmas*](lbry://truechristmas) – Rust and Marty from HBO's True Detective are in fact Santa and his top Elf, unraveling the mystery of the half-eaten cookie plate.

**[Charney Comedy](https://www.facebook.com/charneycomedy)**

A whole 'nother brand of Los Angeles comedy, Charney specializes in the art of the parody. Check out the top notes:

- [*Lenders' Den (Shark Tank)*](lbry://LendersDen) – America's most addicting reality sensation is back and BIGGER THAN EVER!
- [*Moneyweasel (Moneyball)*](lbry://moneyweasel) – The Los Angeles Snards have a new backdoorsman in left shield, in this recreation of the scene from Moneyball wherein no one still knows what was said.
- [*Loose Cannon (Reservoir Dogs)*](lbry://LooseCannon) – One last job, just like old times. Then they're on the next flight to Bora-Bora. ;^)
