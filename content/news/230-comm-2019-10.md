### What's New at LBRY? {#news}

#### Heisenberg (Desktop) and Cartwheel (Android) released

Our latest release, Heisenberg for Desktop and Cartwheel for Android, is a huge milestone for LBRY. For the first time in LBRY history, your account is synched across all of your devices! 

Making our network easy to use is our main focus, and the LBRY Network has been growing in terms of both users and content on the network. In fact, there are over 1.5 MILLION claims on LBRY.

Some highlights of Heisenberg:

- Unified experience across devices, installs, and computers.
Sign in on any computer and have your balance, subscriptions, tags, and other settings follow you. Or for maximal privacy and security, manually copy your wallet file around: most user settings and preferences are now written to your wallet. You can read more in the Account Sync FAQ.
- Comments on channel pages under Discussion tab.
- Keyboard shortcuts for the following actions
→ to Seek Forward
← to Seek Backward
f to Going Fullscreen
m to Mute/Unmute
- Markdown preview for comments and richer commenting
	- Basic text formatting (bold, italic, strike)
	- URL embeds, LBRY URL previews and channel mentions
	- Code blocks, inline code and blockquotes
	- Embed images and gifs
	
Highlights of Cartwheel for Android:

- Unified experience across devices, installs, and computers.

#### YouTube Sync Claiming and Transfers

Galileo enables a long-awaited feature to close the loop in our [YouTube Sync Partner Program](https://lbry.com/youtube). Now our claiming and transfer process allows creators to take full control of their channels and content. LBRY will only retain access (using a signing key) to publish new items into the channel and can no longer edit any content or the channel metadata itself. 

Learn more about how this process works on our updated [YouTube Sync FAQ](/faq/youtube).

#### LBRY.tv 

We're just about ready to release LBRY to a web browser near you! We did some restructuring on the backend, including migrating our accounts-based model to a wallet-ID one. This creates a better cross platform experience for our users. 

The process included converting all accounts to separate wallets, importing any channels that may have been created, and loading of user wallets on startup. The wallet based model will also allow us to scale LBRY.tv more efficiently as we can choose what wallets are loaded on which SDK instance supporting the front end. 

Eager to give lbry.tv a try now? Head over to [https://beta.lbry.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv) and sign up for an account. 

####  Content Creator Rewards

We’ll be rolling out tiered subscriber and publish rewards to content creators that use the LBRY app and those in the YouTube sync program. For example, this means if you get X subscribers, you’ll be eligible for a reward of Y LBC (specific amounts are still being worked out). For publishing, this will work in a similar way by counting the number of publishes made in the LBRY app. 

For the YouTube program, we’ll also be changing the yearly reward to a monthly one, which includes any prorated amounts since you were last eligible to claim the reward. Be on the lookout in your email box when this is ready to be claimed!

### Selected Hive Updates {#hives}

#### LBRY India

It's been an active time for LBRY India! They've been continously contributing content to the LBRY network, meeting in person, and here is a great example of a good objective for a hive: they have created a LBRY Class channel and have been uploading videos about LBRY topics. You can [see it here](https://beta.lbry.tv/@LBRYClass:2).

In addition to spreading the use and awareness of LBRY, they have been working to address issues facing the future of youth around the world, making their lives better through technology. 

LBRY is excited to participate and has given a grant from the [LBRY.fund](https://lbry.fund) to create and incorporate a legal entity with this purpose, called the Block Youth Foundation.

#### LBRY Poland (aka Erydan Esports Hive)

This hive has been working on a beautiful new website home for [LBRY Poland](https://lbrypoland.com). They have created a playful site guaranteed to appeal to a large audience, drawing on their gaming background. We can't wait to see more from this hive!

#### Noob Team Hive
Big thank you to Noob Team  -- and especially Roman Przybyła -- for completing the Polish language translation, and helping us hunt down all the missing strings and bugs. Because of their hard work, translating the LBRY app into many languages is much easier now.

Also congratulations for Wiktor Kukulski and Roman Przybyła for completing internships with LBRY coordinated with their university. We look forward to having both of them back for another internship session.

#### LBRY China

In addition to working on Chinese language translations on Transifex, the LBRY China hive meets monthly in person, and has been growing their online communities. They boast over 350 members on WeChat and over 4,000 followers on Sinaweibo.

Members from LBRY China are attending the [Blockchain World Forum in Shenzhen](https://blockference.com/blockchain-conferences/blockchain-world-forum-shenzhen-shenzhen-695), October 24-25.

#### LBRY Africa

One of our newer hives, LBRY Africa, is doing a phenomenal job at introducing LBRY to new users, and creating a community excited about the future of media. Since starting, they have held in-person meetups, built a membership of 144 people on Facebook, and over 50 members in their Swarm Whatsapp.
