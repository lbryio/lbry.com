The [LBRY Chat community](http://chat.lbry.io) has welcomed its 4,000th member.

One of the best parts of a community that has grown so much are the creatives who've joined the fray. Crypto-nerds, software engineers, musicians, filmmakers--they loiter online in the harmony that is the LBRY community.

One such creative Slack community member is Austrian 3D printing-engineer-wizard Clemens Mayer.

Mr. Mayer's content is available in both Deutsch and English. A mix of vlogs, livestream events, and tutorials make this yet another one-of-a-kind channel on the LBRY network.

LBRY's first 3D printing and DIY electronics channel can be found at:

You can meet Clemens in person on May 6th and 7th at the [Munich Maker Festival](http://make-munich.de). Maybe he'll have some free LBRY Credits to give away...
