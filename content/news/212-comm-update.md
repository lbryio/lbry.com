## LBRY Announces New Swarm Program {#swarm}
Growing the LBRY Community is a top priority for 2019! To this end, we’re introducing the LBRY Swarm Program. _What is the Swarm, you ask?_

The LBRY Swarm is a community program to promote awareness, use, and development of the LBRY protocol and network. We believe in empowering people across the globe to be able to promote and monetize their content and regain control from corporate-controlled centralized platforms.

If you’re interested in finding out more about the Swarm program, how to start a hive or join one, [please check out this link.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDabPptaLx7TI7DeT_dAOZgeulSRD1A-VnYYypbuc_r4wlhA/viewform?usp=sf_link) We have a discussion list for all, plus Hive Officers get access to a special LBRY team Slack channel. 

The following are some of the LBRY Hives you can join.

### Virtual Location Hives
While many hives are formed based on a geographic location, these hives have general interests and meet virtually. If you want to learn what the Swarm is all about, joining one of these hives is a great place to start! Or, if you'd like, you can [view our regional hives here.](#regional)
