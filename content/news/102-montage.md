At least something's happening. And that something is a surge of new channels joining LBRY as they flee the clutches of YouTube.

We made our own statue of liberty. She's planted firmly at https://lbry.io/youtube, and she welcomes all comers to the promised land of LBRY. Automatically. Without lifting a right trigger finger--or in most cases some WASD + left click.

We welcome Caveman Gaming, EmRatThic, Zed Gaming, Gaming Sicness, and Wingheaven to LBRY. When categories roll out in April, you'll find them in "Gaming."

What does this seemingly gibberish string of words have to do with "Gaming?" They've graciously brought games from AAA and indie to LBRY, including:
- GTAV
- Rainbox 6 Siege
- Warcraft III
- Rocket League (my personal favorite)
- Clash of Clans
- Smite
- Roblox

**Not on LBRY yet?** [Get an invite here](https://lbry.io/get). Have a stream feed you want to add to LBRY? Email [reilly@lbry.io](mailto:reilly@lbry.io) to rage quit YouTube in style.
