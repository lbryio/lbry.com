This week, I'd like to reintroduce one of my personalities on LBRY.

You caught Mr. Moriarty's show Sidequest [in January](https://lbry.io/news/sidequest). Now it's time for the main course.

<video width="100%" controls poster="https://berk.ninja/thumbnails/2pI5sJU3lVI" src="https://spee.ch/9fcd6b485e8088908d84cd2f4c042ab7ce21a47f/the-coming-and-going-of-the-wild-west.mp4"/></video>

The prolific [Colin Moriarty](https://open.lbry.io/%40ColinsLastStand) (CLS, Sidequest, as well as podcast series Fireside Chats and now Knockback) has continued to forge his own path in games and news media with his own blend of political opinion, games criticism, and a wit that kills fluff pieces on site. He's as no-nonsense as they come. Long form interviews, short-form reviews, and video essays on what Trump, Oprah, and reactionary thought mean for America, you'll find no shortage of content from this IGN editor-turned-content-maverick.
