It may be a bit early in the season, but we have a big holiday gift for all our loyal LBRYians! We're pleased to announce the release of LBRY Clarke, the newest (and best ever) version of the LBRY app. Our team's first priority has been improving the reliability, stability, and speed of the LBRY network, and Clarke delivers an odyssey of upgrades on those fronts for both our desktop and Android apps.

We've overhauled the LBRY SDK (the program that allows computers to communicate with one another on our decentralized network), and it's never been this fast! These improvements will boost load speeds considerably across the LBRY ecosystem. During this upgrade, your wallet is also migrated to a new format and old version is [backed up safely](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-backup-wallet#migration).

## Why Clarke?

Arthur C. Clarke arguably created modern science fiction. Obsessed with exploration, during his life Clarke was a major proponent of mankind's journeys to the far reaches of experience, from the depths of the ocean to the void of space. He also helped connect people around the globe - his early work on geostationary satellites was the very beginning of our modern worldwide telecommunications system. Clarke was a passionate believer in the value of human freedom, quoted as saying, "In the struggle for freedom of information, technology, not politics, will be the ultimate decider."

And he didn't just leave his mark in the real world - as a pioneering science fiction author, Clarke brought the ideas of space travel and hard science to an eager audience of laymen. The author of "2001: A Space Odyssey" inspired Stanley Kubrick to create one of the most enduring visions of human frailty and potential ever put to film. Without Clarke, technology like LBRY wouldn't be possible, and without his imagination, the world would be a bit less full of wonder.
