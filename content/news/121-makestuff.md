LBRY is all about sharing your creations with the world.

One thing you can't do (yet!) is sharing your tangible, physical works. But today is the next best thing. Welcome one of the best DIY channels on the web to LBRY.

![I Like to Make Stuff](/img/news/makestuff-inline.jpg)

Bob of <a href='https://open.lbry.io/@ILikeToMakeStuff'>@ILikeToMakeStuff</a> builds anything and everything for the fun of it, and you're along for the ride. Stormtrooper helmet? Check. Outdoor tool bed? Check. Rube Goldberg machine? Easy peasy.

If you're like us, you spend a lot of time building things indoors. Not moving. At a desk.

Bob shows you just how fun building cool things that you *actually* want to make can be, all while getting your blood pumping.

Bob, LBRY. LBRYians, Bob.
