LBRY has come a long way since its inception, and we’re working harder than ever to thrive in the niche this environment has provided for us. In honor of the power of natural selection, we’ve named this release “Darwin.”

While Darwin’s journey of discovery in the Galapagos took years, we’ve made discovery a whole lot easier for our users. When you [upgrade your app](/get), make sure to check out the slick new search options (and better results). When you find something you really like and want to send a referral link to a friend, we’ve got you covered! We now provide a referral link right in the app.

Most of all, we think you’ll be impressed with the improved speed and reliability of this newest app. Isn’t that what it’s all about? Time to load has never been faster.

Head over to [LBRY’s new arcade!](https://open.lbry.com/%40OpenSourceGames) You can now play a number of free, open-source games in-app. We’re still working on this feature, so be on the lookout for more games and a better user experience with the player over the coming months.

If you haven’t opened LBRY on your computer in a while, now’s the time to do it! 

We need your feedback to make LBRY even better - upgrade in-app or [head to this link](/get) to download LBRY now, and let us know what you think on [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lbryio)! 

If you’re a developer and want to dive a bit deeper into the process, take a look at the [release notes here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop/releases/tag/v0.29.1) or jump right into our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/lbryio/).

Thanks for helping us build the decentralized internet of the future - we can’t do it without you!
