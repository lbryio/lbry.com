LBRY hit some pretty significant milestones since the first of the year, and the momentum just keeps building with the addition of a new core team member and the opportunity to showcase our "magic box" to the crypto community.

For those new to our project, LBRY harnesses the same blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin to make sharing media radically inexpensive and censorship-proof. It's the first decentralized, open-source, fully encrypted content distribution platform, and we have iTunes, Netflix, the Kindle Store, and other Silicon Valley titans in our crosshairs.

Things are moving at breakneck speed...

**In February, we released an alpha version of LBRY's Graphical Interface on OS X El Capitan** and [unveiled our software publicly for the first time with a live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-yk5NYy1o) at [Liberty Forum 2016](https://nhlibertyforum.com) (sorry for A/V quality - we're saving money by doing all recording on a stack of spare VHS tapes from 1982).

**Today, we are excited to announce the addition of data scientist Dr. Michael Zargham to the LBRY team.** Zargham is going to open up a lot of avenues for us through his intense intellect and professional associations. He's the guy that can take complex datasets and mathematical equations and put them to practical use. He earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and has over a decade of experience building problem-solving tools for businesses. Zargham has [more than a dozen academic papers to his credit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mczargham), and his work has been cited extensively.

**The crypto community will have an opportunity to meet the LBRY team this weekend at the [2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo](https://mitbitcoinexpo.org).** This will be our first chance to show off the LBRY platform to the community that literally built our foundation.

We're excited about connecting with our roots, but make no mistake: our mission is to grow a platform that will put cryptocurrency in every living room – whether or not users care that it's there!
