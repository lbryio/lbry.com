- Search, browse, then download or stream all LBRY content.
- Upload original content.
- Send LBRY credits (LBC) between users.

LBRY is a content-sharing and publishing platform that is decentralized and controlled by its users. It allows content creators to post their works to the hosting network, set their price per view/download, and collect payment.

LBRY is an open-source protocol, as opposed to a centralized service, so there is no entity to take a "cut" of transactions or change the terms in an attempt to monetize the product. It's like a new extension of the internet for delivering all media – films, ebooks, songs, and apps – from creators directly to consumers with radical efficiency.
