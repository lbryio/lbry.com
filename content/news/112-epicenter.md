The crypto scene is young. And with youth comes a dearth of quality shows to watch. We've already [been graced](https://lbry.io/news/cryptoverse) by a [few](https://lbry.io/news/crypt0) of the greats on LBRY.

But today's show takes the cake.

There *is* one person they haven't interviewed yet, but the name is escaping me...
