National borders shouldn't stop the flow of digital content. But they often do.

As Estonian President Toomas Hendrik explained in an interview with Ars Technica, [he can't buy a song on iTunes for his wife](http://arstechnica.com/business/2016/05/why-cant-the-estonian-president-buy-a-song-off-itunes-for-his-latvian-wife):

>"iTunes is based on credit cards. Credit cards are national. I cannot buy an iTunes record for my wife who has a Latvian credit card. I cannot buy her an iTunes record because I have an Estonian iTunes. This is true of virtually everything that is connected to digital services. And certainly, this is why Estonia is at the forefront of the European Digital Single Market. As I like to say, it's easier to ship a bottle of Portuguese wine from southern Portugal in the Algarve and sell it in northern Lapland, than it is for me to buy an iTunes record across the Estonian-Latvian border."

As Ronald Reagan said, "Tear down this wall!"

LBRY does just that.

Using LBRY Credits (LBC), you can access content from anywhere in the world, from wherever you happen to be. You don't have to worry about credit cards, country-based lock-in by subscription services, or local censorship.

Together we can build a world of content without borders!
