Welcome to this week's creator spotlight!

[KAC Creative](https://open.lbry.com/@KACCreative:4) makes beautifully crafted, scored, and shot videos showing the creation of treats that are somehow even more attractive. Be entranced, educated, and hungry all at the same time!

[Vibrant Green Oil for Plating](https://open.lbry.com/@kaccreative:4/vibrant-green-oil-for-plating:0) is an quintessential KAC Creative video. Great music, a cooking lesson, and an art lesson rolled into one.

But the education you will get from KAC Creative goes beyond just recipes. For example, she will teach you that [agar agar is used for cooking and not the mating call of a deaf bird.](https://open.lbry.com/@kaccreative:4/what-is-agar-agar-how-do-you-use-it:0)

The lessons you'll find are contemporary. In fact, we think it is possible KAC Creative is a time-traveller here to bring back the food of the future.
