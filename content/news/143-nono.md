I've heard a rumor that there's no Thanksgiving in France, and that every day is League of Legends Day.

But I'm just a camper and couldn't solo mid to save my life, so what do I know?

Introducing the *first* French-speaking channel to LBRY and the first LoL streamer...

<video width="100%" controls poster="https://berk.ninja/thumbnails/uyo8s7hE9xY" src="https://spee.ch/9ac8454a292304d8b6e2309fc6698b354a436cc6/nono-adc-master-best-of-1.mp4"/></video>

Nono, a Season 1 LCS (League Championship Series) player in EU, shows some of his games, his e-sport events and Summoner's tips to a French-speaking audience, right here on LBRY at [lbry://@Nono](https://open.lbry.io/%40Nono) or  [spee.ch/@Nono](https://spee.ch/@Nono).

*Nono ex-joueur LCS, joueur de LoL au haut niveau depuis longtemps, propose ses conseils pour s'améliorer ! Autant rendre l'expérience que j'ai acquis sur le jeu, profitable à tous.*

It's high time that LBRY supported the most popular game on the planet. Please support your favorite streamers by tipping LBC in-app via the Support button. Because you can't win a match without good supports. Did I mention we need a Healer?
