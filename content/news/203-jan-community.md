### 2018 Year Review and Roadmap Check-in {#roadmap}
Jeremy Kaufmann, our CEO, [penned a retrospective on 2018, and announced our goals for 2019.](/news/lbry-in-2018-2019) We’re super excited about the new updates to our Roadmap, which also relies on **YOU** to help us revolutionize the content world!

2018 was filled with great accomplishments for LBRY, and Jeremy's blog summarizes these wins, including: protocol performance, new features, our YouTube partnership program, Android app beta, huge increase in content, lbry.fund debut, lbry.tech soft launch, major press coverage, and social growth.

#### 2019 Focus Areas

* **User Engagement:** LBRY in your browser: Plans are in place to bring the full LBRY desktop app experience to the web! Making LBRY easier to access will boost user engagement. Content discovery is also important: we want users to be able to find relevant LBRY content easily in the desktop app, on the web, and in search engines.
* **Win Creators:** We want to show our creators lots of love by introducing new tools to track, build a fanbase, and better monetize content. We're also working to make it easy to use and spend your LBC.
* **Build Community:** YOU are our most amazing asset! We're introducing better documentation and tools for using and developing with LBRY. To this end, we're launching lbry.tech, and later this year, lbry.org, which will enable our LBRY Swarm to grow.  
* **Technical Improvements:**  We saw great download speed and failure rate improvements in 2018, and this remains a top priority in 2019. We're also planning to take LBRY to the next level technically, creating better tools for a more robust marketplace, and laying the groundwork for future ease of scaling.

#### Roadmap Updated for 2019

* **Android 1.0 app release:** We want to move from our functional beta into a robust 1.0 release.
* **User commenting in the LBRY app:** This is a big step towards making LBRY-based applications more socially interactive.
* **Improve protocol performance:** We made huge strides in 2018, and want to make downloads even faster.
* **Technical Community:** Launch LBRY.tech and continue to build our technical community with excellent documentation and tools.
* **Website redesign and brand unification:** We want everything we do to look consistent, professional, and super-easy to use.
* **Community swarm:** We want to enable building communities within the LBRY ecosystem using existing social tools and developing better tools to support and grow community. 
* **New creator features:** Create new tools for creators to have better control and presentation of their properties, track statistics about their files, and easily edit metadata.
* **Focus on creator partnerships:** Create active partnerships with prominent creators to better promote both the creators and LBRY technology.
* **Discovery:** This is a multifaceted issue. We want users to be able to find relevant content on the LBRY network, whether they're in the desktop app or doing a web search. We want to increase general awareness of LBRY.
* **LBRY on the web:** You will be able to access LBRY in your web browser in addition to the standalone desktop app.
* **Multi-device experience:** We want you to be able to access your LBRY content and wallet accross multiple devices.
* **Advertising:** Explore advertising solutions for folks who would rather view advertising than pay a small fee for downloading content.
* **Blockchain Bricklaying:** Continue to implement measures to preserve the security of our blockchain.
* **LBC On/offramps:** We want to make it easier for you to acquire or spend LBC.
* **Community Metadata:** Explore proposals, choose a design, and receive community feedback.
* **Internationalization:** Add local language support to our web properties and applications.
* **Robust Data Market:** Improve incentive for participation in the LBRY network and host data.

### LBRY.tech {#LBRY.tech}
While LBRY.tech soft-launched in 2018, we've been hard at work fleshing out the content and adding great features for anybody who'd like to learn about the LBRY protocol and developing using our API.

Also part of the lbry.tech rollout, we're launching a developer specific mailing list with resources and updates about developing on LBRY. We welcome all levels of developers to our project. You can [join the list here at the bottom of this page.](https://lbry.tech/resources)
