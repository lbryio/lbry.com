At the root of LBRY is that emergent, beautiful mesh of communication: Peer-to-peer.

Jamie King has been a leading thinker and filmmaker in the P2P movement, having covered the relationship between intellectual property and P2P distribution since the debut of his feature film *Steal This Film* and subsequent podcast, STEAL THIS SHOW presented by Torrent Freak.

The first of two new shows are coming exclusively LBRY to expand the tradition: [Unbubbled with Jamie King and Sarah Henry](https://open.lbry.io/%40Unbubbled). The pilot episode features [Emin Gun Siren](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor), renowned crypto-currency researcher and Cornell professor, and his anti-bitcoin counterpart David Gerard, the author of *Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain* [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Attack-50-Foot-Blockchain-Contracts/dp/1974000060). Is bitcoin a boom, bust, or something else entirely?

And coming November 2017 is STEAL THIS SIDESHOW, a bi-weekly video podcast of the best asides from Jamie King's STEAL THIS SHOW presented by TorrentFreak.
