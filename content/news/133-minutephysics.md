The science marathon continues with one of the biggest scientific series on the internet.

Don't worry, this won't take long.

[@MinutePhysics](https://open.lbry.io/%40MinutePhysics), created by Henry Reich, came from humble beginnings, such as explaining simple concepts like dark matter and gravity. He's since educated the world in bite-size pieces on virtually every popular science concept under the sun (or in proximity to it). Want the TL;DR for [landing on Mars sometime soon](https://open.lbry.io/why-it-s-hard-to-land-on-mars)? Or perhaps you want to know once and for all: [is there a cat or not](https://open.lbry.io/how-to-teleport-schro-dinger-s-cat)?
