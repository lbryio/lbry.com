People do strange things for seemingly mystical reasons.

Jordan Peterson cuts through the mist and gets to the heart of, well, everyone's heart.

A professor and psychologist at the University of Toronto, Dr. Peterson has lectured, written and made videos covering some of the most deeply profound topics of our time in an accessible way. From [postmodernism](https://open.lbry.io/jp-Urd0IK0WEWU), to what the Bible [says about our relationship to authority](https://open.lbry.io/jp-R-GPAl-q2QQ), to [debating house bill C16](https://open.lbry.io/jp-KnIAAkSNtqo), he covers the root of humanity's collective psychology in earnest.

A commenter on his Biblical series summarized his channel best:
