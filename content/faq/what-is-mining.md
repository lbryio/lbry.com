title: What is Mining?
category: mining

Mining is a process where computing power is used to verify transactions on LBRY network and add them to the public ledger (LBRY blockchain).
It is also a process of how additional new LBRY credits (LBC) are created as a reward for the successful miners. 
The process uses the mining software to calculate complex mathematical puzzles in order to secure the transactions.  
Both CUP and GPU hardware can be used for mining, which is computationally very intensive. 
To put it in the most simple terms: mining enables secure and fast LBC transactions.
