title: How does content hosting work?
category: getstarted

Right now, it's simple: you host what you download.

While the LBRY app is running, it communicates to the network whatever content you're making available.

Think of it like how torrents or any other peer-to-peer (P2P) service works. First, you download a file from the host(s) that have made it available via seeding.

When the download has finished, you become a host in the network (seeder) that other people can download from.

**Please note: Hosting fees are currently disabled on the network as we're currently working on a better way to implement the fee structure.**
