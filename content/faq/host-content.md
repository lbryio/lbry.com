title: How does content hosting work?
category: getstarted

Right now, it's simple: you host what you download.

While the LBRY app is running, it communicates to the network what
content you're making available.

Think of it like how torrents or any other peer-to-peer (P2P) service 
work. First, you download a file from the hosts that have it available. 
When the download has finished, you become a host in the network 
other people can download from. 

**Please note: Hosting fees are currently disabled on the network as we work on a better way to implement the fee structure**
