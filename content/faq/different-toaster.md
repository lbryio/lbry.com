title: How is LBRY different from a toaster?
category: differences

Toasters transfer heat via radiative EM waves in the infrared spectrum to brown bread and make people happy.

LBRY transfers data via EM waves in the infrared spectrum* to deliver content and make people happy.

LBRY is also brave and little. So we're basically, fundamentally the same as a toaster.

\**Assumes fiber-optic transmission.*

There happen to be a lot of technological advancements that have happened to toasters. These scientific feats apply to LBRY, as well.

### Multithreading

![Now that's a lot of threads!](https://spee.ch/dd1aa7f0db34d4bba810573d489c0fc857d0c492/t0.png)

Properly-applied multithreading has allowed the distribution of workloads in LBRY, freeing up time that could have been spent waiting for required actions.

### Multi-role, Multi-function

LBRY can service many forms of data, such as videos, pictures, and sourdough.

### Network Optimization

In this day and age of cool acronyms (such as IEEE 802.11**ax**) and now-common internet integration into devices, LBRY too has joined the crowd. TLNI (Toaster-Level Network Integration) technology has been fused with LBRY, permitting speeds at least as fast as your dial-up modem.

### Open-source

Proprietary toasters may try to limit what you can put in them and your ability to look into the toaster's operation. LBRY is a different kind of toaster. Its full source code is available online at [its GitHub repos](https://github.com/lbryio).

### Mobile

Lightweight versions of TLNI and LBRY have been made and ported to Android. Take LBRY on the go!
