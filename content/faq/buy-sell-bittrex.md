title: Buying and selling LBC on exchanges
category: getstarted
---
This guide is meant for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. 

Currently, in order to exchange LBC for traditional currencies (and vice versa), you'll need to use [cryptocurrency exchanges](/faq/exchanges). LBRY is actively working on ways to make this easier right inside our applications, but we don't have an ETA on when this would be available. 

Some exchanges have a US Dollar (USD/USDT) market, whereas others only trade LBC against Bitcoin (BTC). This means you'd need to go through BTC first before being able to obtain traditional currencies like USD. These steps below are an example of how to buy and sell LBC on Bittrex, but the mechanism of using order books will be similar on other exchanges.

If you are acquiring LBC, you'll need to have BTC deposited into your account, link a bank account to deposit USD, or use a credit card (not available in all locations). If you are selling LBC, you'll need to [deposit the LBC to your Bittrex account first](#Withdrawing-LBC-to-Bittrex).
