On lbry.tv and the Desktop app, you can purchase LBC directly with a credit card through [MoonPay](https://moonpay.io) via an integrated buying process. Once the purchase is complete, the LBC is deposited into your wallet. 

Some users/regions may require additional verification, potentially via government ID, by MoonPay in order to complete their purchase.
