Searching for content on LBRY is easy! We'll start with lbry.tv and Desktop first, then cover [Android below](#android).

## Searching on Desktop and lbry.tv

Click your cursor into the top bar, and enter a search term. Typically, you'll see at least 3 items at the top:
1. **Search** - Default if enter is clicked. This is your typical search option, will return all results matching it.
2. **Exact URL** - Select this to navigate directly to the content published at `lbry://comics`
3. **Tag** - Select this to navigate to the tag page to browse all content tagged `comics`

After performing a search, you'll have access to additional filters to help narrow down the results.
- Filtering to _files_ will return content published according to the selected file types.  
- Filtering to _channels_ will return only channel results.

## Searching on Android {#android}

Select the top bar and begin typing. Once you pause or click enter, the search results will appear. Currently there are no filtering options on this platform.
