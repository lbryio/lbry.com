LBRY videos can be embedded on your blog or other sites you want the video to play directly on. This is done via a simple HTML code snippet that includes an iframe to lbry.tv.

## How to embed a video via an iframe

1. From the content page, click the Share button.

## What does an embed look like?

Here's a sample lbry.tv iframe embed, generated by follow the above steps for the video [Meet lbry.tv](https://open.lbry.com/@lbry:3f/meetlbrytv:c?r=9PLaAYVfz6NLQa81fdSLpcvVhWm7joNV):

## What else do I need to know?

1. When an embedded video is played, it will count as a view for your content.
1. If a user visiting the site has a lbry.tv account, their views may also [count as tips](/faq/rewards#contentview).
1. You'll be credited with an invite if the user signs up for a lbry.tv account later (and their first video play was from your embed).
