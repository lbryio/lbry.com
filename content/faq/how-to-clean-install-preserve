title: How to do a clean install of LBRY while preserving important data
category: setup
---

Under certain circumstances, it may be recommended that you perform a clean installation of LBRY.  This generally involves uninstalling the current LBRY application, removing various directories/files and then reinstalling the latest version of LBRY.  Since each Operating System has its own set of working directories, it's a good idea to review: https://lbry.io/faq/lbry-directories before proceeding.  

After uninstalling LBRY, the working directories are left intact so that the application can be easily reinstalled without losing your application data and wallet file  Application data is in the lbrynet folder (LBRY folder for Mac) and it includes various database and configuration files.  Wallet and blockchain data is in the lbryum folder. Typically, you would want to save your wallet and a handful of configuration/database files when performing a clean install in order to keep your important data intact.

*Note: After running LBRY after a clean install, you may be prompted again for your email, this is normal. If for some reason you need your verification code resent, please email help@lbry.io or reach out to us on Slack!*
