Yes, please visit [Coinomi](http://www.coinomi.com) to download their excellent and easy to use wallet, and [ViaWallet](https://viawallet.com/) which is powered by ViaBTC, the owner of CoinEx. You can also use the [LBRY Desktop App](https://lbry.com/get) or [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv) simply as a wallet. 

For technical users, we have

- [electrum]( https://github.com/kodxana/LBRY-Vault/releases/) - Electrum clone for LBRY. Supports [multisig and Ledger](https://lbry.com/faq/multisig) also.

- [lbrycrd](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd/releases), a full blockchain node very similar to bitcoind. See Readme for full details.
