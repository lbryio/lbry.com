***WARNING: Currently, the LBRY app does not support the LBRYcrd wallet, but this functionality may be available in the future***

Start LBRY with the `--wallet` flag set:

    lbrynet-daemon --wallet=lbrycrd

Note: when you change the wallet, it is persistent until you specify you want to use another wallet - lbryum - with the --wallet flag again.
