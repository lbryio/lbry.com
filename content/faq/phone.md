## Why we ask

LBRY controls [Millions of Credits](/faq/credit-policy) that it wants to get into the hands of content creators and content consumers.

Unfortunately, when running a rewards program, people may abuse it.

Phone number approval provides an alternative method for LBRY users to participate in the [rewards](/faq/rewards) program.

## What if my phone number isn't working?
Certain regions, prepaid services, and VOIP numbers will be blocked from phone verification to combat abuse. If you are having trouble with getting a phone number accepted, please see one of the [other approval methods](/faq/identity-requirements).

## What if LBRY says my phone number already exists?
This usually means that there is another LBRY account/email address already associated with that number. If you are changing email addresses and need to link your accounts or you believe this is an error, please [reach out to us](mailto:help@lbry.com).
