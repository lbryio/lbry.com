### Why we ask

LBRY controls [millions of credits](https://lbry.io/faq/credit-policy) that it wants to get into the hands of content creators and content consumers.

Unfortunately, when running a rewards program, people may abuse it.

Phone number verification provides an alternative method for LBRY users to participate in the [rewards](https://lbry.io/faq/rewards) program.

### What if my phone number isn't working?
Certain regions, prepaid services and VOIP numbers will be blocked from phone verifications in order to combat abuse. If you are having trouble with getting a phone number accepted, please see one of the [other verification methods](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements).

### What if the LBRY app says my phone number already exists?
This usually means that there is another LBRY account/email address that's already associated with that number. If you are changing email addresses and need to link your accounts or you believe this is an error, please [reach out to us](mailto:help@lbry.io).
