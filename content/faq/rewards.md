title: What are LBRY Rewards?
category: getstarted
---

To provide a rich user experience and to [distribute](/faq/credit-policy) LBRY Credits (LBC) into the hands of new and returning users, LBRY created a Rewards system where credits are earned by completing tasks throughout the application. Rewards are given to promote application testing, learning certain in-app skills, building the LBRY economy through purchasing and publishing content, and as a small "thank you" gift for being part of a revolutionary digital media platform. For qualified users, Rewards are issued automatically by the LBRY app into each users' [LBRY wallet](/faq/how-to-backup-wallet). **Note: There is a limit of 3 Reward redemptions per day**.

### Rewards Approval requirements

In order to be eligible for LBRY Rewards, users must have an approved account via [phone number](/faq/phone) or [credit card](/faq/identity-requirements) (there's also a manual approval method on [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com)). If users choose not to become approved for rewards, LBRY works with full functionality, but they will not be able to earn any free credits from LBRY.  **Rewards will only be granted on a 1 account per household basis and LBRY reserves the right to revoke Rewards privileges on any account if abuse is suspected or if VPN/shared connections are used.**

Rewards are added to your LBC wallet balance as they are completed. All the rewards can be listed by clicking on the tab marked **REWARDS** inside the LBC wallet. They are also marked in the [transaction history](/faq/transaction-types).  Rewards redemption is tied to your account, but the credits themselves are stored in your local wallet file which is required to be [backed up](/faq/how-to-backup-wallet) periodically.

### Custom reward codes {#reward-code}

Custom reward codes can be claimed via the [Rewards](https://open.lbry.com/?rewards) page in the LBRY app. You may have been given a reward code via email, social media or you stumbled upon it somewhere - whichever way, you can claim it for LBC today! It's simple, just hit `Enter Code`, type it in and press `Redeem`.
