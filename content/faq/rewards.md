title: What are LBRY Rewards?
category: getstarted
---

Rewards allow LBRY users to earn LBC, the token that powers the LBRY network. You can earn rewards for watching content, creating an identity, and generally learning about and using LBRY.

**Please note:** Reward amounts are subject to change at any time by LBRY Inc.

## Rewards eligibility

To be eligible for LBRY Rewards, you must:

- Sign up for an account at [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv)
- Verify your email
- Potentially complete an [additional verification step](#additional-verification) (common if using from VPN or a fraud-prone network)

Rewards are intended to be earnable on a per-person basis (typically limited to 1 rewards account per household / location). LBRY reserves the right to revoke rewards privileges on any account if abuse is suspected, including on the basis of VPN or shared connections. Users on shared connections will typically not be eligible for rewards. 

## Do I need to be eligible for rewards?

LBRY works with full functionality without rewards and there's never a requirement to earn rewards or sign in to lbry.tv.

## How do I claim a reward?

Some rewards will automatically be added when you complete them. Others require an explicit click or acknowledgement to receive.

All the rewards can always be seen by clicking **Rewards** from the Account drop down menu (top right of the app). 

Rewards that you have earned will be marked in your [wallet](/faq/transaction-types).

## Followers reward {#followers}

You receive additional rewards as you build a following on LBRY. Only verified LBRY users count, so there may be a discrepancy between what you see on your channel page. Share your channel with the world to earn more LBC!

| Number of followers | Amount |
--- | ---
| 1 | 2 LBC
| 5 | 10 LBC
| 20 | 20 LBC
| 100 | 100 LBC
| 500 | 250 LBC
| 1,000 | 800 LBC
| 5,000 | 3,000 LBC
| 10,000 | 8,000 LBC

_Not seeing this reward despite being eligible? If you created your channel while not signed in to lbry.tv, we might not know about it. Publishing something new while signed in to lbry.tv will restore eligibility._ 

## Views reward and tips {#contentview}

You may receive additional rewards for views from validated lbry.tv accounts. You will see these on your wallet page as Tips and they will be summed up monthly on your Rewards page. You may [unlock the tips](https://lbry.com/faq/tipping) to have the show in your balance, but while locked, they help your content be discovered. 

Please note: Not all accounts may qualify for view rewards. These are generally reserved for original content and may not apply to non-video content. Accounts that participate in follow for follow / view for view activity will not be eligible. LBRY reserves the right to disable view rewards on any account, similar to other rewards. 

## Custom reward codes {#reward-code}

Custom reward codes can be claimed via the [Rewards](https://open.lbry.com/?rewards) page on LBRY. You may have been given a reward code via email, social media or you stumbled upon it somewhere - whichever way, you can claim it for LBC today! It's simple, just hit `Enter Code`, type it in and press `Redeem`.

**Please note:** Reward code sharing is strictly prohibited and rewards privileges will be revoked.

## What is the additional verification step? {#additional-verification}

Accounts created from networks that have above average fraud rates or that make it difficult to detect fraud may require additional verification steps.

If this step is required, you will be notified when creating an account or entering the rewards area, which will then walk you through it.

The additional verifications are:
- Via [phone number](/faq/phone) 
- Via [credit card](/faq/identity-requirements)
- Via [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com).
