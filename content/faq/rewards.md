title: What are LBRY Rewards?
category: getstarted
---

Rewards allow LBRY users to earn LBC, the token that powers the LBRY network. You can earn rewards for watching content, creating an identity, and generally learning about and using LBRY.

## Rewards eligibility

To be eligible for LBRY Rewards, you must:

- Sign up for an account at [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv)
- Verify your email
- Potentially complete an [additional verification step](#additional-verification) (common if using from VPN or a fraud-prone network)

Rewards are intended to be earnable on a per-person basis. LBRY reserves the right to revoke rewards privileges on any account if abuse is suspected, including on the basis of VPN or shared connections.

## Do I need to be eligible for rewards?

LBRY works with full functionality without rewards and there's never a requirement to earn rewards or sign in to lbry.tv.

## How do I claim a reward?

Some rewards will automatically be added when you complete them. Others require an explicit click or acknowledgement to receive.

All the rewards can always be seen by clicking **Rewards** from the Account drop down menu (top right of the app). 

Rewards that you have earned be marked your [wallet](/faq/transaction-types).

## What is the additional verification step? {#additional-verification}

Accounts created from networks that have above average fraud rates or that make it difficult to detect fraud may require additional verification steps.

If this step is required, you will be notified when creating an account or entering the rewards area, which will then walk you through it.

The additional verifications are:
- Via [phone number](/faq/phone) 
- Via [credit card](/faq/identity-requirements)
- Via [Discord](https://chat.lbry.com).
