title: What are LBRY Rewards?
category: getstarted
---

To provide a rich user experience and to [distribute](https://lbry.io/faq/credit-policy) LBRY Credits (LBC) into the hands of new and returning users, LBRY created a Rewards system where credits are earned by completing tasks throughout the application. Rewards are given to promote application testing, learning certain in-app skills, building the LBRY economy through purchasing and publishing content, and as a small "thank you" gift for being part of a revolutionary digital media platform. For qualified users, Rewards are issued automatically by the LBRY app into each users' [LBRY wallet](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-backup-wallet). **Note: There is a limit of 3 Reward redemptions per day**.

### Verification requirements

In order to be eligible for LBRY Rewards, users must have a verified account via [phone number](https://lbry.io/faq/phone) or [credit card](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements) (there's also a manual verification method on [Discord](https://chat.lbry.io)). If users choose not to verify themselves, LBRY works with full functionality, but they will not be able to earn any free credits from LBRY.  **Rewards will only be granted on a 1 account per household basis and LBRY reserves the right to revoke Rewards privileges on any account if abuse is suspected or if VPN/shared connections are used.**

Rewards are added to the LBC wallet balance as they are completed. All the rewards can be listed by clicking on the tab marked "REWARDS" inside the LBC wallet, and they are also marked in the [transaction history](https://lbry.io/faq/transaction-types).  Rewards redemption is tied to your account, but the credits themselves are stored in your wallet which is required to be [backed up](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-backup-wallet) periodically.
