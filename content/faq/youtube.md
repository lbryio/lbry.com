**Moving your channel onto LBRY**

LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to sync their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC.

To sync your existing channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.io YouTube Sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

There is a size limit per video of 2GB. There is a total count limit of your most recent 1,000 videos. What this means, if that isn't clear, is that your most recent 1,000 videos that are smaller than (or equal to) 2GB in size will be synced to LBRY.

Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to moving your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one-year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](https://lbry.io/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

*Please note: users won't see their channel/content in their LBRY app under `My LBRY - Publishes` until LBRY sends their wallets/claims over - a more automated process is still being worked out. However, the content will be accessible through the LBRY Desktop app / spee.ch*

The sync process stores your wallet in a secure location, as you may not have the LBRY app installed already. If we send the wallet to you now, we won't be able to keep your YouTube channel in sync, and therefore, we recommend waiting until we have a better solution for sending this data to you. Please reach out to [help@lbry.io](mailto:help@lbry.io) if you have any questions about this process.
