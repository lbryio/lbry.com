LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to sync their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC.

To sync your existing channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.io YouTube Sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to moving your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](https://lbry.io/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

If you're having any trouble with the sync process or receiving your credits, please contact [help@lbry.io](mailto:help@lbry.io).
