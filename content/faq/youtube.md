The YouTube Sync process available within the [LBRY app](https://lbry.io/get) allows you to automatically mirror your existing YouTube channel onto the LBRY network. It is a free service for YouTubers not yet ready to go full-time on LBRY as a publisher but still want to make their content available for LBRY users. For the enterprising independent publisher, you are encouraged to [claim your channel and publish content](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-publish) to LBRY directly through the app and master the LBRY App yourself, without using YouTube Sync.
