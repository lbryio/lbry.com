**Moving your channel onto LBRY**


***Service Announcement: Our queue is a bit behind at the moment, so please bear with us! You'll receive an email once your sync is complete. Content will be out of order, but this will be fixed with our next app release in a couple of weeks. If you qualify for a reward (i.e., if you have over 1000 subscribers and have recently posted content), you will be able to claim this in the app. Please continue reading below...***

LBRY offers an easy way for YouTubers to sync their content to the LBRY network, engage with LBRY users, and earn LBC. This is intended for content creators that aren't quite ready to make the switch over to using the LBRY app at this time, and want us to keep their YouTube channel updated on LBRY. Not all channels qualify for the YouTube sync / rewards program, but users can always [upload the content themselves](https://lbry.com/faq/how-to-publish) through the LBRY app instead. 

To sync your existing channel to LBRY and learn more about the program, use the [LBRY.com YouTube Sync page](/youtube).

***IMPORTANT NOTICES: You won't see your content in the LBRY app under `Publishes` nor have control of the channel until LBRY transfers control of the synced content to you. We're actively working on an automated process for this which will be ready by the end of the northern hemisphere summer. However, your content will be accessible through the LBRY Desktop app and [LBRY.tv](https://beta.lbry.tv) (see the links in your sync email). You also won't be able to claim the Publisher/Identity rewards in the app until the transfer is complete, though you will be able to claim your sync reward by following the instructions below.**

**If you want to experiment with publishing manually in the LBRY app, you can create a test channel under a different name. If you create one with the same name, there will be duplicates and we won't be merging them. You can delete the content/claim you created locally using the trash can icons on the transactions page. We will be automatically updating channel pages (i.e., cover art and descriptions) from your YouTube profile in the coming weeks. Thank you for your patience and understanding!**

Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to re-publishing your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

There is a size limit per video of 2GB. There is a total count limit of your most recent 1,000 videos. What this means, if that isn't clear, is that your most recent 1,000 videos that are smaller than (or equal to) 2GB in size will be synced to LBRY.

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. Receiving these credits is subject to a one-year agreement. The exact agreement you make when you sync can be seen [here](/faq/youtube-terms). The current rewards for syncing can be seen on the [sync page](/youtube).

The sync process stores your wallet in a secure location, as you may not have the LBRY app installed already. If you are comfortable with [swapping out wallet files](/faq/how-to-backup-wallet), we can work with you to transfer your synced wallet as part of a manual process. Typically, we recommend waiting until we have an automated solution for transferring this data to you via the app. Please reach out to [help@lbry.com](mailto:help@lbry.com) if you have any questions about this process.

**How to Receive Your LBRY Credits for Syncing**

You can do this once your channel has been synced.

- Download the LBRY App from [/get](https://lbry.com/get)
- Run the LBRY App
- Make sure the email saved in the application matches the email address on your [Sync Status Page](/youtube/status) - you can update this and make sure to verify via the email you receive (the email may not update but it will link together)
- Click on the **Rewards** option from under Account in the sidebar. 
- Scroll to the "YouTube Reward" tile and click Get XXXX LBC.
- If you met a particular subscriber threshold (minimum 1K subs, 10 videos), you should receive the appropriate amount of credits.

If you're having any trouble with the sync process or receiving your credits, please contact [help@lbry.com](mailto:help@lbry.com).
