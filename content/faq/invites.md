You can earn LBRY Credits (LBC) for inviting others to use LBRY as well as letting us know who invited you. Invite new users to LBRY via email or a customized link on the [Invites page of LBRY Desktop or lbry.tv](http://open.lbry.com/?invite). This page will also show the status of existing invites. Both the inviter and invitee are eligible for a reward. 

*Note: Referral redemptions are typically limited to 20, but increases as your channel grows in popularity on LBRY. See the [limits section below](#limits)*

## Finding your invite link and status
To get to the [Invites area](http://open.lbry.com/?invite), click the Account menu in the top right and select **Invites**. You can now customize your invite link by selecting one of your channels from the drop down. Any of them will work, but the email we send out will include your largest subbed channel. You can also invite a user directly via email.

You will also see all of your invites, along with their status(es) - whether the user has accepted it (signed in) and if it is claimable or not (if the user is reward approved).

## How does the invite link work?

When a user clicks your invite link, they are greeted with a welcome message and option to create an account. They will also automatically subscribe to your channel.

## When do I get my rewards?

If you have claimable invites, you will see a claim button with the total reward amount on the page. You will not receive rewards for each referral until those users join and use LBRY themselves (see below section regarding claimable invites). This is to combat invite fraud and abuse.

## Claiming your bonus for being invited and setting the inviter
For a limited time, you can claim a reward for being invited and letting us know which channel did so (so they can earn also). You must set the inviter before claiming your reward.

## How many LBRY Credits do I earn?

New invites are eligible for a 8 LBC reward (subject to change based on our discretion).

## Is there a limit to the Credits I can earn? {#limits}

The default limit for claimable invites is 20. Your limit increases as you use LBRY more and your channel grows in popularity. If you want us to review your account and allow for more redemptions, please first make sure you've claimed your maximum and then [email us](mailto:help@lbry.com) with details about yourself and users you are inviting. This is typically reserved for creators or influencers.

## What is the difference between accepted and claimable?

Accepted means the user has signed into LBRY. Claimable means they have verified their account.

## What are the criteria for a claimable invite?

A claimable invite has the same definition as a Rewards eligible or Verified LBRY user. This means the referred user must have logged into LBRY and validated their account for rewards. Unclaimable means they have not been validated for rewards or are not eligible.

LBRY users who abuse either the Invite or Rewards system will not be eligible for invite redemption. If you have specific questions about individual invites which are not claimable, please reach out to the [helpdesk](mailto:help@lbry.com) with details.

## I have a clever idea to cheat the invite system

If you want to waste your time to receive no reward, be our guest. We will monitor the system closely and go to significant lengths to only allow legitimate users to join.

Rather than spending the time attempting to cheat and failing, we suggest you do productive work to earn LBRY Credits. Join our [Discord chat](http://chat.lbry.com) and message or email [Tom](mailto:tom@lbry.com) (@jiggytom) or [Julie](mailto:julie@lbry.com) (@jsigwart) for opportunities.
