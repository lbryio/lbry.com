As a power user, you may want to run your own commands against the LBRY SDK. This guide explains how to run any available commands from the [LBRY SDK documentation](https://lbry.tech/api/sdk). You must be running the LBRY app or daemon in order to interact with the protocol.

In recent versions of LBRY, the lbrynet-cli tool is no longer included with the App and must be downloaded/copied into the appropriate folder (see below). [Download](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/releases) the version that matches your Settings > Help > `Daemon` version number. 

## Windows
1. Open a **Command Prompt** application window
1. Type `cd "C:\Program Files\LBRY\resources\static\daemon"` ([32-bit located in Program Files(x86)]) and click Enter
1. Type `lbrynet-cli status` and click **Enter**. This will return the LBRYnet status data
1. See examples below or [LBRY CLI documentation](https://lbryio.github.io/lbry/cli/) for additional commands

## MacOS
1. Open a **Terminal** window
1. Type `cd /Applications/LBRY.app/Contents/Resources/static/daemon`
1. Type `./lbrynet-cli status`  and click **Enter**. This will return the LBRYnet status data
