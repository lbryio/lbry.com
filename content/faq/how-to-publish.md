## How to publish content on LBRY

Download the LBRY app [here](https://lbry.io/get)

LBRY is a free, open, and community-run digital marketplace.  Publishing content in LBRY is how you share your content for free or choose to get paid directly from your viewer.

### How to create a channel
1. Open the LBRY app. If it prompts you to update, run the update to be on the most recent version.
2. Load the application and  click the `Publish` button.
3. In the `Channel Name` section click the dropdown and select `New Channel` and  declare the name you would like for your channel.  For more details on different channel types, see our write up on [naming](https://lbry.io/faq/naming).
4. Once your name is selected, there is a `Deposit` section that is below.  It requires a minimum bid of .0001 LBC (see more on deposits [here](https://lbry.io/faq/naming)).
5. Click `Create Channel` once you have selected your bid amount.  Your deposit is a bid and if this channel isn't claimed by another bid, the channel is yours to use. You now own `lbry://@channelnameyoubidon#` and `lbry://@channelnameyoubidon` if you are the highest bidder.

### Publish Content to a Channel
