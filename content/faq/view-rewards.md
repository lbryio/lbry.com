Creators that produce quality content that other users enjoy are monetized in a number of ways not limited to:
- Earnings per view from us (Rewards based on validated views from users that are signed in and hold validated accounts).
- Tips from users.
- Site/app promotions.

If you upload quality original content, you [may be eligible to receive view rewards](#apply) from us.

## How do earnings per view work?

We track views from Odysee and other LBRY apps. When a user with a validated account views a creator's content, the creator receives a payment of Credits (LBRY Credits) for that view and is designated as a **Tip** on the wallet page. To prevent abuse, the first 7 daily validated views from a user will qualify.

## How do I check how much I earn per view?

Click the User Avatar icon from the front page and then Channels to see your rate.

**Please note**: your rate is subject to change and is based on a number of variables including: average watch-time, average view count, type of content, engagement, creator location, price of Credits, overall network usage etc. As a result, the rate moves up and down a bit on a regular basis. View rewards will also be limited if a creator earns over 1% of the weekly reward pool of Credits.

## How do I see a summary of what I have earned or been tipped?

Click the Credit icon in the top right corner of the front page - this will take you to your wallet.
Filter transactions by **Received** and **Tip**.

Earning per view rewards will also be summarized monthly on the Rewards page under `Content View Tips: Month Year`.

## How do I claim tips that I have earned per view and from users?

By leaving your tips locked in your content or channel, it increases its trust and discovery on the platform. 

To unlock, access your wallet, and filter transactions by **Received** and **Tip** and **Active**. You'll seed a padlock icon next to tips you've received.
Click the padlock icon to unlock the tip you want to claim and have it enter your balance.
