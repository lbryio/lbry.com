We take security very seriously. Send an email to <security@lbry.io>, and we'll get back to you ASAP. Bounties will be paid in LBC for valid security reports based on information provided and severity.

Our GPG key is [here](/faq/gpg-key). You can encrypt a message to us using this [web form](https://keybase.io/encrypt#lbry).
