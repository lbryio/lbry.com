The LBRY project sources are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/lbryio).

To install LBRY from source, you'll need the [lbry](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) repository for the LBRY SDK and [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) repository for the Desktop application. Further documentation is available in the respective repositories, READMEs and [contributing](https://lbry.tech/contribute) documentation.

You can find more information about building on and with LBRY at [https://lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech)
