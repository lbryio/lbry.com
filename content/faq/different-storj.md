title: How is LBRY different from decentralized cloud storage, like Sia or Storj?
category: differences

Sia and Storj are both doing interesting things with decentralizing cloud storage, but in a way that is pretty different from LBRY.

Decentralized cloud storage companies are meant to be replacements or analogs to Dropbox, CDNs, or other privately controlled tools. These aren't systems where all of the content put into them is intended for public consumption. Instead, they are systems where the publisher pays a price for a promise that his content will be made available subject to certain conditions. 

LBRY is designed to do one thing and only one thing well: the discovery, access, and (optionally) purchase of digital content. LBRY isn't a place to backup your private personal photos, it's a place to publish something if and only if you want it to be discoverable and accessible by others.

By being designed from the ground up for a highly specific purpose, LBRY can both deliver better experience and move faster than attempts to create a similar system on top of other decentralized platforms.
