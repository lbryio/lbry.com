title: How is LBRY different from MaidSafe / Storj?
category: differences
---

MaidSafe and Storj are attempting to be decentralized platforms that enable many uses, rather than a decentralized protocol designed to serve a singular purpose.

LBRY is designed to do one thing and only one thing well: the discovery, access, and (optionally) purchase of digital content.

By being designed from the ground up for a highly specific purpose, LBRY can both deliver better performance and move faster than attempts to create a similar system on top of other decentralized platforms. All three ventures are in an early stage, so it is an open question which will achieve mainstream adoption.
