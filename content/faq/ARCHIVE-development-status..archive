title: What is LBRY's development status right now? Plans for the future?
category: developer

LBRY is currently in invite-only beta, with desktop apps for Linux, MacOS, and a pre-release version of Windows. There are approximately 5K active users and hundreds of content creators. The network already hosts big-name content like the [feature film *It's A Disaster*](https://lbry.io/news/launch-a-disaster) and videos from [Adult Swim's MillionDollarExtreme](https://lbry.io/news/mde-on-lbry). We announce new featured content every Thursday on our [blog](https://lbry.io/news), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lbryio), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lbryio).

The waitlist to get into the beta is ~150K people long. This shocks even us, and we're racing to get the user experience and backend technologies to a level where we're comfortable opening the beta to everyone. The target for open beta is this winter. Mushy target, we know, but these things are hard to time.

In the meantime, we could use your encouragement. This is a difficult project that cannot succeed without people demonstrating they want an alternative to Silicon Valley megacorp media services. So [join the beta](https://lbry.io/get), [share our blog posts](https://lbry.io/news), and [join our subreddit /r/lbry](https://www.reddit.com/r/lbry). Your excitement is like Red Bull to our weary coders!
