The LBRY Android App allows you to view free and paid content, upload your digital media for free or at a set price, tip your 
favorite creators, send/receive LBRY Credits(LBC) and earn credits through LBRY Rewards. The app runs on top of the 
[LBRY protocol](https://lbry.io/faq/what-is-lbry) which is a peer to peer, decentralized file sharing and payment 
network secured by blockchain technology. 

The purpose of this FAQ is to answer questions about some of the basic functionality available in the LBRY Android App. 
Please see our [other FAQ entries](https://lbry.io/faq) for additional information.

### What is the purpose of having my email connected to LBRY?
Emails are collected to authenticate and [uniquely identify](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements) users so that they can 
be eligible for [LBRY Rewards](#rewards), sync subscription data and to stay up to date on the latest LBRY happenings. 
No other data is stored with your email login. All other data, including your [wallet](#wallet), [downloads](#data) 
and published content are stored locally on your computer.

### How do I change my LBRY connected email?
If you ever need to change your LBRY Android App email address or sign out, please see [this guide](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-change-email). If you sign into a new email and need to transfer your verification status, you'll need to [reach out to us](mailto:help@lbryio) in order to link your accounts. Please do not verify again to obtain rewards on a 2nd account; your Rewards account may be disabled for abuse.


### What if I want to run LBRY on multiple android devices?
If you want to run the LBRY app on multiple PCs or on other platforms like Android, you can sign in with the same email 
on all devices. Each installation will still have its separate wallet and download data (as mentioned above). 
Any rewards earned will be sent locally to the wallet where they are claimed. In the future, our goal to enable an 
opt-in wallet syncing service across devices. 

### What are LBRY Rewards? {#rewards}
[LBRY Rewards](https://lbry.io/faq/rewards) are used to distribute LBRY Credits(LBC) to new and existing users by allowing 
them to explore app functions and complete tasks which generate LBC as an award. In order to be eligible for Rewards, 
you need to [verify your identity](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements) which uniquely identifies you as an LBRY user.


### What is a wallet and how do I find it? {#wallet}
A wallet is a secure, digital wallet used to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies like LBRY Credits(LBC). 
The LBRY Android App comes with its own wallet and is stored locally on your phone and nowhere else! 
**It is critical that you [backup your wallet data](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-backup-wallet) in case you lose access
to your phone or need to [migrate](https://lbry.io/faq/backup-data) to a new one.**

To find your wallet in the LBRY App, click on the 3 horizontal bars at the upper left side of the App next `Discovery`. 
Clicking it will open a side bar and click on wallet.This will open the wallet page which shows your balance and recent
transactions.

The LBRY wallet is different from other cryptocurrencies because it also stores your shared content's metadata in the 
form of [claims](https://lbry.io/faq/naming) when using the [publishing features]((https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-publish). 
Claim related [wallet transactions](https://lbry.io/faq/transaction-types) ensure that the blockchain uniquely identifies
your content and the payment/tips can be routed appropriately. 

### Where do I find my LBC wallet address?
You can find your address by first clicking on Wallet on the leftside of the LBRY Android APP.
