title: How is LBRY different from YouTube / Netflix / Apple TV?
category: differences
---

YouTube, Netflix, Apple TV, and other similar services are centralized platforms controlled by a single corporate entity. These companies have the ability to change the rules unilaterally, as well as censor content to appease authoritarian governments or corporate partners.

LBRY is a decentralized, open-source protocol that is controlled by its users. LBRY facilitates a similar experience to the aforementioned services but does it in a way that is entirely decentralized. LBRY can never unilaterally change the rules on publishers or consumers, making it dramatically more trustworthy.
