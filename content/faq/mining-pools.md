title: Are there any mining pools?
category: mining

Absolutely. Here are links to some of the pools. Each pool will have different instructions on how to join and get set up.
While we try to work with reliable pool operators, LBRY Inc. does not officially run or endorse any one pool.

However, some pools are in a partnership with the independent community initiative at [LBRY.Community](https://lbry.community). These pools fund development and expansion of the community by donating 10% of their LBC revenues. This is a great way to contribute directly to the community!

The current breakdown of mining hash rates can be found on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/lbry)
