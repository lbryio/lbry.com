Absolutely. Here are some links to the pools. Each pool will have instructions on how to join and get set up.
While we try to work with reliable pool operators, LBRY Inc. does not officially run or endorse any one pool.

However, some pools are in a direct partnership with the independent community initiative at https://LBRY.Community. The community pools fund their development and expansion. This is a great way to contribute directly to the community!
