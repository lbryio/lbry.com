Account deletion is a manual process at this time. If you'd like to proceed with account removal, please [email us at hello@lbry.com](mailto:hello@lbry.com). You can then uninstall/sign out your LBRY application or sign out of lbry.tv. Any LBC and downloaded content you may have had will persist on your device, see our [directories FAQ](https://lbry.com/faq/lbry-directories) to find these locations.

Please note: If you have earned Rewards on your email address, we'll put your email into a dormant state and you'll never hear from us (all other data deleted). Otherwise, it will be completely removed.
