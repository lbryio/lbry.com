You can earn credits for referring others to use LBRY.  As of 8/1/2017, we have paused referrals because LBRY has entered an "Open Beta" status where anyone can download the software. We have recorded all your referrals and are moving this information into the LBRY Application.  This information is not available at your referral link at this time, nor can your referral link earn any more credits. 

### How many credits do I get?

The current referral reward as well as the number of people you have referred has been recorded by our system

You will always receive the number of credits being awarded at the time your referree joined the list.

### How do I see how many credits I've earned?

We've recorded all the credits you have earned up until 8/1/2017 and they be shown in inside the LBRY App once that feature is implemeneted.

### When do I get my rewards?

We are working on a solution where each user can redeem their rewards via the LBRY app.  When this goes live, you will then be able to claim your referral rewards. 

You will not receive rewards for each referral until those users join and use LBRY themselves. This is to combat referral fraud.

### Is there a limit to the credits I can earn?

If you expect to refer more than 50-100 people, please discuss it with us on [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) or email [us](mailto:josh@lbry.io).

### Will you turn Referrals back on? 

Once we have the Referral system implemented in the LBRY App, we plan on turning them back on so that users can earn credits for referring their friends and family. 

### I have a clever idea to cheat the referral system.

If you want to waste your time to receive no reward, be our guest. We will be monitoring the system closely and going to significant lengths to only let legitimate users in.

Rather than spending the time attempting to cheat and failing, we suggest you do productive work to earn LBRY credits. Join our [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) and message Josh (@finer9) or Jeremy (@kauffj) for opportunities.
