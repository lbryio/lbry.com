title: How does the referral and waitlist program work?
category: getstarted
---

You can earn credits and move up the LBRY waitlist for referring others to use LBRY.

### How do referrals affect my status on the waitlist?

The more LBRYians you refer, the sooner you'll be granted access and the more credits you'll earn.

### How long will I be on the list? How frequently do you take people off?

We anticipate taking anywhere from several hundreds to several thousand off each week. It depends on how development continues.

Your wait time will depend on how many you invite and how long you've been on the list. See below.

### How do you determine who to take off the list?

Your waitlist score is the sum of number of weeks on the list and number of people invited. We take the people with the highest scores every time we do another invite wave.

Currently, invites outside of English speaking countries are paused pending better international support.

### How many credits do I get?

The current referral reward as well as the number of people you have referred can be seen on the [Get](/get) page.

The referral award may change without warning or notice. You will always receive the number of credits being awarded at the time your referree joined the list.

### How do I see how many credits I've earned?

Access the [Get](/get) page. If it does not already display your status when you load the page, simply enter your email address again.

### When do I get my rewards?

You will not receive any credits until you get off the waitlist. As soon as you do, you will receive an acceptance bonus. You will not receive rewards for each referral until those users join and use LBRY themselves. This is to combat referral fraud.

### Is there a limit to the credits I can earn?

If you expect to refer more than 50-100 people, please discuss it with us on [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) or email [us](mailto:josh@lbry.io).

### I have a clever idea to cheat the referral system.

If you want to waste your time to receive no reward, be our guest. We will be monitoring the system closely and going to significant lengths to only let legitimate users in.

Rather than spending the time attempting to cheat and failing, we suggest you do productive work to earn LBRY credits. Join our [Slack](http://slack.lbry.io) and message Josh (@finer9) or Jeremy (@kauffj) for opportunities.
