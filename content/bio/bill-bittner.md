Bill's primary contributions were to [spee.ch](https://spee.ch), an open-source web application built on the LBRY Protocol.

Billâ€™s long-standing fascination with web applications eventually led him to utility-driven blockchains and, naturally, LBRY.

When he is not hacking on web apps, he enjoys drawing, playing soccer, and slowly working his way through his Steam library.
