Jimmy is the second comp science/physics graduate from Rensselaer. After, he found himself mired in government bureaucracy, spending too much time to get too little done.

Ready to work on a project he believed in, Jimmy left a national security programming job to start LBRY. Jimmy created the LBRY protocol and the first LBRY application.

Jimmy is a Bitcoin fanatic and has been since its early days. He has long been interested in the benefits of decentralization.
