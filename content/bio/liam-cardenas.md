Liam joined the LBRY mission in Fall of 2017 to improve user interface and experience. As a lifelong entrepreneur and crypto-anarchist, the LBRY project was of high interest to Liam on many levels – meeting the team and learning more about app development goals made his decision to become a full-fledged LBRYian an easy one.

Liam’s sincere passion for making distributed censorship-resistant software easy to use has been a boon to the team. In addition to his work with LBRY, Liam is also an advisor to several startups and blockchain projects.
