Amit arrived at LBRY through mining. Diving into the world of cryptocurrency, he discovered LBRY Credits amongst the most profitable to mine. A few Slack messages later, he was making pull requests to the backend python code on Github.

When heâ€™s not contributing his talents to LBRY, he loves practicing synth, guitar, and deeply contemplating quantum computing. Amit is a third year IT undergraduate at National Institute of Technology - Durgapur in Durgapur, West Bengal, India.
