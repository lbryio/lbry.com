Amit arrived at LBRY through mining. Diving into the world of cryptocurrency, he discovered LBRY Credits amongst the most profitable to mine. A few Slack messages later, he was making pull requests to the backend python code on Github.

When he’s not contributing his talents to LBRY, he loves practicing synth, guitar, and deeply contemplating quantum computing. Amit is a third year IT undergraduate at NIT in Durgapur, West Bengal, India.
