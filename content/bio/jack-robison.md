Jack's path to developer with LBRY is fairly typical: [face sixty years in prison for innocent chemistry experiments](http://www.masslive.com/localbuzz/index.ssf/2009/06/actionreaction_how_one_teens_c.html); lose interest in chemistry; [program insane electric guitars for Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXZi4UZjiiI&t=10); decide to revolutionize the internet.

Jack was one of the first people to discover LBRY and took to it so fast he may understand more about it than anyone.

Jack has Asperger's Syndrome and is actively involved in the autism community. He was a regular on Wrong Planet's Autism Talk TV, has appeared on _National Public Radio_, the _New York Times_, and presents around the country.
