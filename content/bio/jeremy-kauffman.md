Jeremy knows how to build and scale a startup starting from day one. He knows how to deliver usable products and get those products in front of the right people.

Jeremy created LBRY because he fell in love with the idea of shared, global content registry that is owned and controlled by no one. Unsurprisingly, he is a longtime supporter of decentralized technology and freedom of information.

Prior to LBRY, Jeremy founded [TopScore](//usetopscore.com), a startup that processes millions of dollars monthly in event and activity registrations. He attended [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](//rpi.edu), where he received degrees in physics and computer science.
