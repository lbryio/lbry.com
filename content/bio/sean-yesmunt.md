Sean is a recent addition to the LBRY team who has hit the ground running with serious contributions to the project as an app engineer focused on user experience (he spends his time making the LBRY app easier to use). Sean was part way through an Aerospace Engineering degree at Penn State, when he decided he didnâ€™t want to end up working on rockets for the government.

So, he did what many LBRYians have done, and dropped out to focus on coding. His excitement for crypto and open-source projects focused on decentralization, led him to discover LBRY, which he began working on the very same day. His passion for developing intuitive user experiences have been a welcome addition to the team.
