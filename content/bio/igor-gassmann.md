Igor is an intern on the app team. By the time he turned 16, Igor’s driving passion was clear (and it was not high school). So, he dropped out, and moved to Switzerland to build a career in software development.

It was Igor’s participation in [Praxis programs](http://discoverpraxis.com/) that led him to LBRY. His long time interest in the crypto market and blockchain technology, coupled with his desire to work in a start-up environment, made LBRY seemed like a perfect fit (and the team agreed!). When he is not coding, Igor enjoys discussing economics, philosophy, and politics.
