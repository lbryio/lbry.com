Brinck’s range of experience includes national political campaigns, RV sales, crisis PR, SEO writing and optimization, construction labor, and digital marketing consulting. An inveterate music and media lover, Brinck remembers the pain of Kazaa and Limewire, and is seriously psyched about living in the future where it’s easy to compensate artists directly for their work. He lives in Manchester, NH, where he is training to compete in the Granite State Strongman Competition this summer.
