Natalie has been interested in blockchain technology and open-source everything since the early days of Bitcoin, and has been recruiting, managing operations, and coaching top notch talent to success for even longer.

Internally, she spearheads the systems, procedures, and communications efforts that help the team to work to its potential and remain efficient as the LBRY project grows and becomes more complex. Externally, she is focused on authentically representing the LBRY mission and the team working tirelessly to keep it moving forward, through creative partnerships, sometimes-hair-brained schemes, and a drive to connect with everyone, all the time, that has been described as "intense" - if she calls you to talk about LBRY, pick up. Just do it.
