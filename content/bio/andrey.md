Andrey got into web programming twenty years ago and has done it all, from Perl CGI programming to UI design. At a turning point decided to focus on server-side applications, making exciting technologies accessible to both fellow developers and users. Easily fascinated by distributed and decentralized things. Values understandable code and can agonize over naming a variable for days. Works mostly when everyone is asleep. When not working, travels around South-East Asia, doing scuba diving wherever thereâ€™s water around.
