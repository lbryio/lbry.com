Create a script that will automatically message all new members of our Slack channel.

The message sent must be loaded dynamically from a URL.

This [GitHub project](https://github.com/orliesaurus/greetingslack) is a good example of what's required. However, a few modifications are required:
- Message must be regularly pulled in from a dynamic URL
- Must run on Digital Ocean instance
