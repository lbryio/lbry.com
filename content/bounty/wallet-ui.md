Add a basic wallet interface to the LBRY Browser [`lbry-desktop`](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop).

The interface must support:
- Generating a new wallet address.
- Sending a variable number of credits to a specified address from the active wallet.
- Displaying an address to receive credits.
