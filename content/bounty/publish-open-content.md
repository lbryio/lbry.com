There are a large number of open content sources. Everything from public domain movies on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/movies) to books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

This project is to programmatically index, download, and port this content to the LBRY network.

Credits will vary on the difficulty and usefulness of the source. We will provide credits to reserve the names for content. You must open-source any code created for this bounty.
