title: Internationalization of LBRY App

The LBRY App is currently lacking support for internationalization.

To complete this bounty, [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) must be modified as follows:

- Add [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) internationalization calls to the React app
- Store selected language in the user settings
- Load and perform translation based on language settings
- Existing component text and messaging must be wrapped in translation calls

It is probably a good idea to consult with our development team on [Discord chat](https://chat.lbry.com) or via [email](mailto:hello@lbry.com) before completing this bounty in its entirety.
