<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>

<p>So far, everything we've done with LBRY has been free. However, some actions, such as reserving a name or purchasing paid content, require credits.</p>
<p>
  There are several ways to obtain credits. See <a href="/faq/earn-credits" class="link-primary">this page</a> for options. We also reward
  testers and contributors, so <a href="http://chat.lbry.io" class="link-primary">join our Discord Chat</a> if you'd like to help.
</p>

<p>To receive credits, you will need to generate a wallet address:</p>
<code class="code-bash"><span class="code-bash__prompt">$</span>curl 'http://localhost:5279' --data '{"method":"wallet_new_address"}'
<span class="code-bash__response">["bbFxRyWCFRkA9YcuuZD8nE7XTLUxYnddTs"]</span></code>

<p>Once you have received or purchased some credits, confirm your balance by calling <code class="code-inline">wallet_balance</code>:</p>
<code class="code-bash"><span class="code-bash__prompt">$</span>curl 'http://localhost:5279' --data '{"method":"wallet_balance"}'
<span class="code-bash__response">[50.00000000]</span></code>


<h3 id="publish">Publishing</h3>
<p>Publishing to LBRY is just as easy as everything else!</p>
