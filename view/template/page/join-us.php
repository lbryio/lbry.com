      <h1>Join Team Content Freedom</h1>

      <p>
        Changing the landscape of content distribution is no easy task. LBRY is growing rapidly, and we're always looking for great people
        to join us. If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding pursuit, if you want to work with a team that shares your passion and
        curiosity, you've come to the right place.
      </p>

      <h2>About LBRY</h2>

      <p>
        Some things to know about working at LBRY:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We understand the importance of <a href="http://blog.deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">autonomy, mastery, and purpose</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We judge you entirely by what you produce. We don’t care how long you work, where you work, how you work or what credentials you
          have. We care about what you get done.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are extremely transparent, flat, and open-minded. While you will have clearly delineated responsibilities, you are welcome and
          encouraged to contribute beyond those areas. We judge ideas and results, not ranks and titles.
        </li>
        <li>
          We believe great results can only come from great people. If you’re interested in
          working <a href="/team">alongside people</a> who are bright, creative, and diligent, LBRY is a strong choice.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who We're Looking For</h2>

      <p>
        There's no one kind of LBRYian. We value people who can bring new perspectives to our team. Here are some traits that are important to us:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ability to solve complex problems in simple ways. LBRY has many moving parts, but we try our hardest to power it with simple code.
          Your job is not just to solve problems, but to solve problems in a way that will last and can easily be picked up by other people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knack for user-experience and user-perspective. Even if you're designing the guts of our DHT, what you create ultimately has to work for real people. Our user base ranges from casual web surfers to cryptonerd power users and you'll need an ability to
          understand how to create solutions that work for both.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliable and independent. We expect a lot out of you, but we won't keep tabs on you. You must thrive in that kind of environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          No degree, credential, or age requirements. If you can do the work, we don't care how you got the skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone that appreciates our CTO would <a href="https://gist.github.com/lyoshenka/0a43205aa9a072b196ff87e2c689a8b9">create this document</a> and then link it in a job posting.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Positions</h2>

      <p>
        Contact <a href="mailto:joinus@lbry.io">joinus@lbry.io</a> if interested in a position. Please include the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A resume, Linked In profile, or other resource that would serve as a work history.</li>
        <li>A code sample. Preferrably a link to a public repository for a project you have built or significantly contributed to.</li>
        <li>One sentence about why you'd like to work for LBRY.</li>
      </ol>
        
          

      <h4>Protocol Developer</h4>

      <p>
        We're seeking a developer to work on the core LBRY protocol. As our network multiplies in size, we need to keep it working smoothly.
        You'll be working on the LBRY protocol and DHT, so experience with distributed systems and networks
        is a plus. This work also relates to blockchains and cryptography. Our code is primarily in Python and uses the Twisted framework.
      </p>

      <h4>API Developer</h4>

      <p>
        Do you have strong opinions on API design? Know when to use a 303, and when a 307 is more appropriate? This is the perfect role for you.
        This role involves building auxiliary services used to onboard creators and users. It involves interactions with the LBRY blockchain and work in Go, SQL, and the AWS platform.
      </p>

      <h4>Frontend Developer</h4>

      <p>
        Do you want to think you could build a better UI than YouTube? The LBRY app gives users a
        a simple, intuitive way to interact with LBRY, without requiring any knowledge of blockchains or DHTs. We use modern
        JavaScript along with React and Electron.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Work</h2>

      <p>
        Interested in contributing but not ready for commitment? We have several <a href="/bounty">smaller projects</a> available for anyone
        who wants to do them. We also have a <a href="/faq/contributing">guide for contributors</a> to help you find other ways to get
        involved. If none of that suits your fancy, join our <a href="https://slack.lbry.io">Slack channel</a> we'll help you find something
        you'll love.
