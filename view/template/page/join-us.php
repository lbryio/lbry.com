      <h2 id="about">About LBRY</h2>

      <p>
        Some things to know about working at LBRY:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We understand the importance of <a href="http://blog.deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">autonomy, mastery, and purpose</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We judge you entirely by what you produce. We don’t care how long you work, where you work, how you work or what credentials you
          have. We care about what you get done.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are extremely transparent, organizationally flat, and open-minded. While you will have clearly delineated responsibilities, you are welcome and
          encouraged to contribute beyond those areas. We judge ideas and results, not ranks and titles.
        </li>
        <li>
          We believe great results can only come from great people. If you’re interested in
          working <a href="/team">alongside people</a> who are bright, creative, and diligent, this is the place.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="looking">Who We're Looking For</h2>

      <p>
        There's no one kind of LBRYian. We value people who can bring new perspectives to our team. Here are some traits that are important to us:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Ability to solve complex problems in simple ways. LBRY has many moving parts, but we try our hardest to power it with simple code.
          Your job is not just to solve problems, but to solve problems in a way that will last and can easily be picked up by other people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knack for user-experience and user-perspective. Even if you're designing the guts of our DHT, what you create ultimately has to work for real people. Our user base ranges from casual
          web surfers to crypto-nerd power users and you'll need an ability to understand how to create solutions that work for both.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliable and independent. We expect a lot out of you, but we won't keep tabs on you. You must thrive in that kind of environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          No degree, credential, or age requirements. If you can do the work, we don't care how you got the skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone who appreciates that our CTO would <a href="https://gist.github.com/lyoshenka/0a43205aa9a072b196ff87e2c689a8b9">create this document</a> and then link it in a job posting.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <?php echo View::render('content/_jobs')  ?>

      <h2 id="applying">Hiring Process</h2>
      <p>
        Click "Apply" next to any job listed above to begin the process. We use a 3-step hiring process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A brief (30 minute max), non-technical, introductory phone call with either the CEO, CTO, or appropriate lead.</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All technical hires are required to complete compensated code contribution on the repository they'd be working on.
            Non-technical hires will also be asked to complete a compensated trial task after they apply and complete step 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Issues tagged "good first issue" are suitable for this purpose, though you are welcome to work on another issue or even something not filed at all.
