      <p>Quite frankly, we're a breath of fresh air. Why <em>not</em> try LBRY and see if it works (for you)?</p>

      <p>You might've done some research and rolled your eyes because we're yet <em>another</em> startup using Blockchain&trade; within our tech stack. Why should you care about that? Well, <strong>utilizing a blockchain allows us to be censorship resistant</strong>.</p>

      <p>The benefits of blockchain + the freedom to be yourself. No middleman required.</p>

      <p>As long as servers exist, so will your content. So, <em>forever</em>. The only thing you have to worry about is content creation and making your fans happy.</p>
