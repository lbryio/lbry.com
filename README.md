## Build URLs
lbry.com provides functionality for redirecting to build assets of other LBRY repos. The general structure is:

`lbry.com/releases/<github_repo_name>.<extension>`

For example, to get the latest [lbry-desktop](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-desktop) release on Windows, you would use the URL:

`lbry.com/releases/lbry-desktop.exe`

Extension is used to get the release for the appropriate operating system, even if the release asset does not match the extension provided.

| Operating System | Extensions
--- | ---
| Windows | msi, exe
| macOS | dmg, pkg
| Linux (Debian) | deb
| Android | apk

The asset returned will match the latest release on the appropriate GitHub repo.

Release candidates can also be targeted. For release candidates, use the following structure:

`lbry.com/releases/pre/<github_repo_name>.<extension>`
